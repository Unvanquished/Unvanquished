  "[drill] Resources"
  {
    "Building a structure requires build points, which are now a one-time "
    "payment – if the buildable gets destroyed, the build points spent on it "
    "are lost.\n"
    "\n"
    "Your team will start with a small pool of build points but more can be "
    "acquired by building a mining structure.\n"
    "\n"
    "Read »Resource generation« for more."
  }
  "[leech] Resource generation"
  {
    "Build points are acquired via two structures – the human [drill] drill and"
    " the alien [leech] leech. These buildings need to be spread out for "
    "efficiency.\n"
    "\n"
    "Builders will see another bar above the health bar of a resource generator"
    " which represents its efficiency. A prediction will be shown when you "
    "position the buildable.\n"
    "\n"
    "The mine rate decreases over time, so that it gets increasingly harder to"
    " acquire resources in a long lasting match. This replaces sudden death.\n"
  }
  "[bsuit] Stages & Momentum"
  {
    "Building and destroying structures as well as killing enemies earns your "
    "team a new resource called ^2momentum^7. If you gain enough momentum "
    "new weapons, structures or classes will be unlocked.\n"
    "\n"
    "Momentum decreases exponentially over time so if you idle your team will "
	"lose access to new items. Existing upgrades will remain functional.\n"
  }
  "[ckit] Human building ^21^7"
  {
    "The [reactor] reactor now supplies power to every point on the map, but "
    "there is a limited amount of energy per region. Human buildables will "
    "compete for power and shut down if they don't get enough.\n"
    "\n"
    "Human builders will see a new bar below the health bar of their "
    "buildables, which shows the spare power a buildable can share with "
    "potential neighbors.\n"
    "\n"
    "If you want to place a greater number of buildables in an area, you can "
    "build a [repeater] repeater to increase the available power. "
    "Be warned that repeaters will deal significant damage to close structures "
    "when they explode."
  }
  "[ckit] Human building ^22^7"
  {
    "When the power consumption in a region is too high, the smallest possible "
    "number of buildables will power down so that the other structures have "
    "enough energy to remain operational.\n"
    "\n"
    "The [drill] drill is the only buildable that requires a close repeater or "
    "reactor to work, since resources are transmitted via the power grid.\n"
    "\n"
    "[turret] Turrets cost more and are a little stronger, "
    "and [armoury] armouries are easier to use and cost less."
  }
  "[flamer] Wildfire"
  {
    "Alien buildables can catch fire when they are hit with the [flamer] flame "
    "thrower or the [grenade] firebomb.\n"
    "\n"
    "If structures are built too close, the fire can jump over to the "
    "unfortunate neighbors.\n"
    "\n"
    "A small fire has a good chance to go out after a while but a group of "
    "burning structures will keep itself hot enough for greater mayhem.\n"
    "\n"
    "The [advgranger] advanced granger's spit attack can be used to put out "
    "fires."
  }
  "[lcannon] Under attack"
  {
    "Destroying buildings will trigger ‘under attack’ warnings for the owning "
    "team if the buildings are in range of (for humans) the [reactor] reactor "
    "or a [repeater] repeater or (for aliens) the [overmind] Overmind. "
    "The name of the location of the repeater will be given if available.\n"
    "\n"
    "The reactor and the Overmind will issue warnings to the team when at "
    "^375% health^7, at ^125% health^7 and when ^1destroyed^7."
  }
  "[basilisk] Mantis"
  {
    "The [basilisk] mantis replaces the basilisk and advanced basilisk.\n"
    "\n"
    "It has a pounce ability, accessed via ATTACK2. "
    "There is a cooldown period, the duration of which differs "
    "for forward, sideways/backwards and off-wall pounces.\n"
    "\n"
    "When moving forward or standing still, flat angles will result in greater "
    "speed, so the pounce can be used to quickly get to the head of distant "
    "enemies but it isn't well suited for getting high up. When strafing or "
    "moving backwards, the mantis will dodge. When pouncing off a wall, it will "
    "attempt to go to the surface you are aiming at."
  }
  "[dev] Miscellaneous"
  {
    "The human dodge has been removed, stamina has been increased, and "
    "battery packs have been removed. Energy weapon clip sizes have been "
    "adjusted accordingly.\n"
    "\n"
    "The grenade price has been increased (200 → 300).\n"
    "\n"
    "All alien evo costs and gains have been doubled. The new maximum of evos "
    "an alien can store is 20 (formerly 9)."
