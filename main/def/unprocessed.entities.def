/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ? DONT_WAIT
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper sounds for this entity, only beep noises. It will spawn in the game and work properly but it sounds silly (see Notes).
-------- KEYS --------
speed: determines how fast the plat moves (default 150).
lip: lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if "height" is set.
height: if set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
dmg: damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat (default 4). Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname: if set, the trigger that points to this will raise the plat each time it fires. The plat raises and comes back down a second later if no player is on it.
light: constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).

_layers OR layers: Integer value is the number unique root shaders that will be use on the terrain.
_shader OR shader: Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.
There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.
Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").

Generic placeholder for inserting MD3 models in game. Requires compilation of map geometry to be added to level. If the map is compiled with Q3Map2, then ASE, 3DS, OBJ and other model formats are supported.
-------- KEYS --------
angle: direction in which model will be oriented.
model: path/name of model to use (eg: models/mapobjects/teleporter/teleporter.md3).
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
angles: Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).
modelscale: Floating-point value used to scale a model up or down (default 1.0).
modelscale_vec: Floating-point vector used to scale a model's axes individually (default 1.0 1.0 1.0).
_remap: Used to remap textures/shaders in the model. To remap all shaders to a given shader, use "*;models/mymodel/mytexture". To remap a specific shader, use "models/mymodel/old;models/mymodel/new".
target: Used to attach the misc_model to a brush entity, where its "targetname" key is the same value.
_lightmapscale: Floating point value scaling the resolution of lightmaps on this model (if model is using lightmapped shaders) (default 1.0).
_cs OR _castshadows: Allows per-entity control over shadow casting.

CASTSHADOW: Toggles the model casting shadows on the map surfaces.
AUTOCLIP: Sets the autoclipping spawnflag, automatically assigning q3map_clipmodel to any shaders used by the model. Use of Q3Map2 autoclipping for models is only recommended for large models with relatively few triangles in their mesh (i.e. terrain). The Q3Map2 autoclipping algorithm is a bit of a hack, and can hurt in-game performance (as well as produce erroneous clipping results) when used on small, dense models.
FORCEMETA: Sets the forcemeta spawnflag, automatically adding q3map_forcemeta to any shaders used by the model (which, in turn, allows the model to become lightmapped). This, effectively, is the "lightmapped model" spawnflag.

-------- KEYS --------
angle: direction in which model will be oriented.
radius: The scale of the model compared to its original size. Defaults to 1.0.
animation: The guts of the entity. This is identical to an entry in an animation.cfg - Start Frame, Number of frames, Looping Frames, Frame rate. For example 0 30 30 20 will play frames 0 through 30 continously at 20 fps.

//=============================================================================
/*QUAKED misc_light_flare (.65 .65 1) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SPAWN_DISABLED
A light flare entity.
-------- KEYS --------
targetShaderName: The name of the shader of the light flare.
radius: The radius key is a vector.
The first component is the size of the light flare. The radius is calculated by taking the distance of the viewer from the light flare and dividing by this key, so the larger the key value, the smaller the flare. Values between 2 and 10 are sensible.
The second component indicates the angle around the direction the flare points for which it is visible. For example a value of 90 means that you can see the flare while infront of the entity, but not when behind it. If set to zero the light flare will be visible from any angle
The third component is similar to the first except that it specifies the size of the light source rather than the size of the light flare itself. This is useful when the higher detail flare fading modes are enabled. If this is set to the same value as the first component, fading will commence as soon as the edge of the light flare is occluded by some surface between the viewer and the flare. If it is set larger the flare will overlap the occluding surface before it begins to fade.
angles: This reflects which direction the flare points. It is not important unless the second component of the radius key is employed. angles is a vector of PITCH YAW ROLL. For example a value of "90 0 0" would create a flare pointing down. ROLL is redundant in this context and can be set arbitrarily.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SPAWN_DISABLED: Spawn disabled.
-------- NOTES --------
Triggering this entity toggles it.

/*QUAKED misc_portal_camera (1 .5 .25) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SLOWROTATE FASTROTATE
Portal camera. This camera is used to project its view onto a portal surface in the level through the intermediary of a misc_portal_surface entity. Use the "angles" key or target a target_position or info_notnull entity to set the camera's pointing direction.
-------- KEYS --------
angles: this sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of the portal camera (default 0 0). Use "roll" key to set roll angle.
target: point this to a target_position entity to set the camera's pointing direction.
targetname: a misc_portal_surface portal surface indicator must point to this.
roll: roll angle of camera. A value of 0 is upside down and 180 is the same as the player's view.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SLOWROTATE: makes the portal camera rotate slowly along the roll axis.
FASTROTATE: makes the portal camera rotate faster along the roll axis.
-------- NOTES --------
Both the setting "angles" key or "targeting a target_position" methods can be used to aim the camera. However, the target_position method is simpler. In both cases, the "roll" key must be used to set the roll angle. If either the SLOWROTATE or FASTROTATE spawnflag is set, then the "roll" value is irrelevant.

-------- KEYS --------
target: point this to a misc_portal_camera that "sees" the view you want to display on the portal.

-------- KEYS --------
angles: this sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of push entity (default 0 0). The roll angle does not apply.

/*QUAKED target_speaker (0 .7 .7) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) LOOPED_ON LOOPED_OFF GLOBAL ACTIVATOR
Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
noise: path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).
wait: delay in seconds between each time the sound is played ("random" key must be set - see Notes).
random: random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay ("wait" key must be set - see Notes).
targetname: the activating button or trigger points to this.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON: sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF: sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
GLOBAL: sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR: sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.
The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

/*QUAKED trigger_hurt (.5 .5 .5) ? START_OFF - SILENT NO_PROTECTION SLOW
Any player that touches this will be hurt by "dmg" points of damage once per server frame (very fast). A sizzling sound is also played while the player is being hurt.
-------- KEYS --------
dmg: number of points of damage inflicted to player per server frame (default 5 - integer values only).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
START_OFF needs to be triggered (toggle) for damage
SILENT: supresses the sizzling sound while player is being hurt.
NO_PROTECTION: player will be hurt regardless of protection (see Notes).
SLOW: changes the damage rate to once per second.
-------- NOTES --------
The invulnerability power-up (item_enviro) does not protect the player from damage caused by this entity regardless of whether the NO_PROTECTION spawnflag is set or not. Triggering a trigger_hurt will have no effect if the START_OFF spawnflag is not set. A trigger_hurt always starts on in the game.
