     * The audio system is split in several parts:
     * - Audio codecs, one for each supported format that allow to load an entire file.
     * - ALObjects that provide OO wrappers around OpenAL (OpenAL headers are only included in ALObjects.cpp)
     * - Audio the external interface, mostly using Sound and Emitter to create new sounds.
     * - Emitters that control the positional effects for the sound sources
     * - Sample that gives handles to loaded sound effects for use by the VM
     * - Sound that controls the raw sound shape emitted by a sound emitter (e.g. a looping sound, ...)
     *
     * In term of ownership, Samples are owned by the hashmap filename <-> Samples, OpenAL sources
     * are allocated in an array in Sound and each source can have at most one sound. Each sound has one
     * Emitter (they are ref counted).
