- got the Debug and Release configs working in VC6, building test binaries
- added pre-link step to wolf to get libcurl compiled and linked in
  NOTE: ET should not be using Multithreaded runtime, it's bad for performance and not needed. Single thread would be much better.
- the Internet SDK needs to be installed and configured in the VC6 paths for win_net.c compile
- remove bg_slidemove_prone.c from game and cgame VC6
- add COPYBINS to copy and strip. need to add brandelfing of the binaries for BSD

	+ Increased MAX_CVAR_VALUE_STRING from 256 to 512 (it's ridiculously easy

	+ Fixed shader caching memory leaks
		- shaders with lightmaps being backed up, not grabbed from cache because they had lightmaps, then never being purged
		- similar story for all shaders with "*BLEH" in them

	+ More fixes for the above, works fine with map changes now too, forcefully purges anything it can find that's left over, 
		not relying on teh counter anymore, as places weren't updating it, and it was generally silly...

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>

		be looking EXACTLY at the door to be able to lockpick it now.

	+ Added botscripttriggers to wolfet_entities.def and code and EntityExtrace.exe
	  - This is a new type of trigger which can be added, modified, moved without recompiling the maps

		+ forcing AUTOUPDATE_SERVER to zerowing.idsoftware.com		

	23-01-2003
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ wrote in the gl_NormalFontBase stuff for Linux
			and then fixed up my crappy code to actually work
		+ added ui for client and server FTP/HTTP download configuration

	22-01-2003
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ adding wwwdl to auto-update stuff
			server: ./wolfupdate.x86 +set developer 1
			client: ./wolf.x86 +set fs_basepath ~/Test/et +set cl_profile TTimo +set developer 1
			hooking back the auto-update ui, updated auto_update.menu
			saving config to update_server.cfg (easier to keep www config around)
			tested a failed www download properly recovers to a regular feed
			kill the HTRequest when done to close the file handle (was b0rking Sys_StartProcess)
			need testing on win32
			NOTE: updated ui/menus.txt and ui/auto_update.menu are required
	
	20-01-2003
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ added wwwdl checksum error recovery. if a client successfully downloads a file from a web redirect,
			but ends up with a wrong checksum, it will refuse to download it again through a redirect, and will tell the server about it
	
	17-01-2003
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ http://login:pass@host/path
			libwww doesn't handle that, we need to process ourselves (proactively add the http basic cookie)

	13-01-2003
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ removed a bunch of Linux .in files, since they depend on the compiling host (and change on each build..)		
	end wwwdl --------------------------------------------------------------------

			Ian		<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Removed break in code to catch outof bounds reachabilities as this caused most SP levels to have massively broken
	  pathing.  "firstreachablearea" needed to be compared to "reachabilitysize" not "numareas", because it is really
	  "firstreachability"

23-01-2003
			Ryan	<ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ Fixed navigational bug introduced with yesterdays changes
	+ Improved func_explosive and func_constructive AAS interaction. Requires recompiled AAS files.
	
			Randy	<ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added new directional dlights. Works as a cool lightning effect, fun for the kids!

23-01-2003
			Ryan	<ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ Added debugging to MP Bot movement code (bot_debug 3, r_debugsurface 2)
	+ Improved area sampling
	+ Fixed BotDirectMoveToGoal() bug where bots would attempt to walk across a gap
	+ Added teamdeath AAS avoidance. Bots will avoid areas with high death rates.
	+ Improved BotDirectMoveToGoal() accuracy
	+ Increased blocking distance check from 3 to 16 units, to help avoidance of stationery objects
	+ Fixed AAS navigational bug which caused bots to get stuck between (clear) walking areas

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed "Q_strncpyz: destsize < 1" crash we'd get if you loaded 2 maps in a row on a release build.
	+ Fixed "failed to load character file" crash we were getting in release builds

22-01-2003
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed crash in corpse characterIndex network transmission.
	+ Added backwards compatibility for map scripts using old spawnbot commands.
	+ Reworked overheating for mountable MG42s.
	+ Added overheating to tank-based MG42s.
			
21-01-2003
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Implemented character system throughout the whole gamecode. Still needs some work but most of the base is there now.
	+ Fixed decals not being fogged properly (thans randy).
	+ Upped version number to ET 2.10h.
	+ Fixed a bug in FixRenderCommandList where drawSurf->sort didn't get calculated properly.
	+ Added old animation.cfg parsing support to the new character system to ease the switch to the new system.
	+ Made corpses use the character system.
	+ Added undressed corpse support to the character system.
	
			Gordon	<djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed precaching of tank mounted gun media (should only really load it if the map contains one though still)
	+ Added caching of tank positions per-frame, saves re-calculating them for various reasons (tracers, etc)
	+ Added some warnings/early out if func_debris has no model

20-01-2003
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Changed fog storage in renderer, fog_t now has a shader_t pointer where it gets the colour and depth values from.
	+ Added new script command: setglobalfog <bool:restore> <int:duration> [float:r] [float:g] [float:b] [float:depthForOpaque] that works with the new global fog.
			
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Added a string pool for cgame window strings.  Halved the mem usage from using static buffers and
	  doubled the number of available lines for a given window.

19-01-2003
			MrE <MrElusive@idsoftware.com>
	+ made several BSPC changes to fight floating point rounding issues
	+ gave Arnout a new AddBrushBevels for q3map2/sdmap2 which fixes most AAS issues

17-01-2003
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Changed cycle command usage: cycle <variable> <start> <end> [step] where step is optional and start can now be larger than end.
	+ Added r_showmodelbounds (mdm/mdx only).
	+ Fixed r_bonesdebug.
	+ Added r_bonesdebug 8 to mdm/mdx (shows skeleton and bonenames).
	
			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fix to SETWEAPON in scripts so that if used after SETWEAPON NONE, weapon will
	  actually take and be reloadable.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Can no longer get bots to pick up class specific ammo items they cannot use.
		And if you manage to somehow order them to pick up something they can't use,
		they'll say "Negative", not spin in circles on the goal.
	+ Can no longer set weapons of bots in squad select screen - this will allow
		the SetAmmoAmount function to work.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bots will be in alert state while avoiding danger.
	+ Improved alertstate (relaxed, alert, combat, etc.) switching.
	+ Fixed the problem where if bot is spawned with a mortar, he will have no idle animations and 
	  lie on the ground like dead
	+ Fixed the runbk/walkbk two-handed-weapon firing so that the gun does not point sideway.

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed various prediction issues with mounted gun
	+ Consolidated the origin/axis setup for the various tank additions into a single function
		- Need to clean this up a bit (precache models), and make more general if we need/want any other tanks like this
	+ Added wait random ability

16-01-2003
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added r_normallength, defaults to 0.5 (CVAR_ARCHIVE)
	+ Finished first pass on making the mdx/mdm animation system allow for multiple mdx files per mesh.
		
			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bots in SP who are about to reload will now leave exposed spots.
	+ In combat, SP bots will only reload when they're actually out of ammo in the clip.
	+ Added script command SetPersonToWatchFor
	+ Added script command ClearPersonToWatchFor
	+ Made a fix to BotPointAreaNum so that it would not return bad areas as often.  This was
	  causing bots to get stuck on some things (The AAS system really dislikes it when the
	  ms->areanum is not the right area, and rightly so).
	+ Adjusted "NeedBackup" VO for SP bots so that it will only happen it they are out of
	  autonomy range of the player, and the player hasn't been shooting recently.
	+ Adjusted "Goodshot" and "Badshot" to be less fickle.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed bug where the script would open the briefing screen and your bots
		wouldn't show up there.
	+ Can now command bots to pick up health packs and meals (not just use Move To, but get Hand cursor,
		and they'll pick them up from a bit of a distance, not try to run on top of them)
	+ Can now command bots to pickup loose ammo if they need it.
	+ Bots told to Hold Position or Move to Location will move to a nearby cover
		spot, if found, after a few seconds at the position.
	+ As per request, removed explicit Medic revive command, so just have heal
		command, which revives when the target is dead.
	+ Medic bots when healing self will not drop medkit on ground, but just heal self.
	+ Fixed bug where allied bots would get stuck crouching forever if you told them
		to hold position while they were crouching.
	+ Fixed bug in bot spawn code with uninitialized data occasionally causing
		bots to spawn with infinite skills.
	+ Fixed bug where bots scripted to start with no weapon would subsequently have
		invisible weapons if they pick one up.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bumped up coverage map size to load bigger maps. 
	+ Removed names from coverage map display.
	+ Hooked up a bunch of after battle animations.
	+ Bot's sound from playsound script command is no longer cut off.
	+ Bots now comment on player's good/bad performance.
	+ Fixed some weird seek cover spot animation issue.
	+ Hooked up low-health animations.
	+ Hooked up heal_self animation (with real heal-self animation coming soon)

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Changed mounted gun code to support the new models from frankie, still needs a little work
		- Need some way to not make it so hard-coded, thinking of using some kinda script..

15-01-2003
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added setspeed script command (<X Y Z> [gravity|lowgravity])

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Hooked up relaxed walk/walkbk/run/runbk/strafe left/strafe right animations.
	+ Removed death_spin.

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Tweaked BotMoveToGoal to make the "Have I not moved far enough"
	  distance to be smaller (since walking Nazis move really slow).
	+ Allied bots in combat without cover spots will move when they're shot (if not crouching)
	+ Nazis will now respond to hearing other Nazis shoot.
	+ Separated minWait time in Fiddling from facePlayerTime, allowing us to make the bots turn
	  to face the player in a time that's independent of when they do animations (I wanted them to
	  turn sooner, but I wanted the animation wait to remain just as long as it was before).
	
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Dlight entity fix for SP (clamped radius to 256, modulate brightness)

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Various fixes in an attempt to make bot knife fighting work better
		- Bots don't avoid their enemy, strafing away from them when they should be stepping in for the kill
		- Fixed some cases where they would decide to fight when they couldn't, so would switch between
			standing, fighting, and chasing over and over
		- Don't use aim accuracy when knife fighting.  I figure they're disadvantaged enough as it is
		- Don't use burst firing code while knife fighting, we figure their arms don't get tired.
		- Don't randomly look away from your target when you're supposed to be knifing him.
	+ First pass at Covert Ops knife attack command which is VERY far from completedness.
	+ Increased Colts and Lugers to have max of 48 bullets in SP from 24.
	

14-01-2003
			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bots will now drop mobile mg42 when they die, as well as carbine, bar, and other
		new weapons.
	+ Angles on seek cover spots work again.  If a bot has no enemy, when it reaches
		its seek cover spot, if an angle was set for that spot, that's the
		direction the bot will face.
	+ If you hit "Listen Up", then give no commands, BJ says "Never Mind" instead of "Go go go"
	+ Fixed bot HUD code that was indicating you could plant mines on
		invalid terrain.
	+ In SP, bots won't seek non-battle goals outside their possible view space - hopefully, will
		keep them from running ahead of you to health crates they couldn't know about yet.
	+ Added bot command icon to tell bots mounted on MG42s to attack with the MG42, not dismount
		and attack.
	+ Bots on Seek Non-Battle Goal (picking up syringes, health packs) will now directly pick them up,
		not hit the use key, and hope they are looking in the right direction.  So they should
		pick up low and high items much better now.
	+ Fixed bug where autonomy pos was no longer being set for the bots, so if they entered combat
		before they got orders, afterwards, they would run off on a quest for the center of the earth.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed a bug with trigger_ammo when the client has flamethrower weapon (so that now you won't hear
	  the ammo pickup sound over and over)

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Rolled Back checkins from last night to pathing code that broke SP pathing (in xpbot_88mm)
	+ Added "Man Down" VO
	+ Added "Revive Me" VO
	+ Tweaked "Need Backup" VO time

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added func_debris entity
	+ Fixed bug in FindShaderInText, again relating to SkipBracedSection (this was a generic q3 engine bug, so backport?)


13-01-2003
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Changed floodprotect to not extend the block periode on receiving of a blocked command.
	+ Removed showcc command, server now just pulses data all the time.
			
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed potential infinite loop in mp if using bot order cycling whilst not being a fireteam leader
	+ Fixed crash with foliage using interleaved texcoord arrays still (well, trying to....)

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ No longer crashes game to give one of your starting squadmates a colt in the script
	+ Fixed bug in rendering selected bot in Briefing screen, where the selected bot always had the
		weapon of the last bot.
	+ No longer draw ! and other icons over heads of bots in SP.
	+ Put in a different marker for queued bot commands.
	+ As soon as a bot is given a queued command, it stops what it's doing and stands still.
	+ Removed "Pre-Alpha" from screens
	+ Removed bot autonomy levels from UI
	+ Fixed bug where medics and field ops would default to using their knife, so when
		you opened the squad select screen, they'd be all confused, and hitting start
		would crash the game.
	+ Bots on follow will once again crouch when the player crouches, UNLESS they're
		seeking cover, in which case they will do whatever their cover spot tells them
		to do.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Reenabled friendly fire avoidance and pain animation from friendly fire (even though friendly
	  fire (damage) is still turned off for SP)
	+ slip_* brush works again (SURF_MONSTERSLICK and related surface parameter) 
	+ When a bot dies, he would slide away from walls (to prevent head of dead body sticking out of a wall)
	
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Entity origin now affects environment mapping (like racing game renderers)

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bots who are in combat and do not have cover spots will now periodically crouch
	  (and Nazis will occasionally do the old battlemove stuff)

---------------- BUILD 037 - 2.10g (etmain)

12-01-2003
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Upped version number to ET 2.10g.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Don't change a bot's view angle when he dies in SP.
	+ Fixed impact point calculation for death animation.
	+ Added bot's name to popup command map.

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Removed hardcoded bot default attributes, and moved it to a file botfiles\botAttributes.bot
	+ Made bots' names fade out after 2 seconds or so in SP.
	+ Fixed a bug whereby "SETWEAPON COLT" in the scripts would nuke medics' medkits and healing ability
	  (and probably would nuke fieldops' special weaponry, too).

11-01-2003
			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Updated SetAlertState script command.
	+ Panzerfaust is now a one-shot weapon in SP.
	+ Say "out of ammo" right away if we just ran out of ammo. also increased the frequency of this VO.
	+ Fixed animation scripts so the special weapon animations will be properly played.
	+ Hooked up a whole bunch of new death animations.

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Adjusted bot movementAutonomyRangeSP values to let low autonomy
	  characters go a bit farther away.
	+ Hardcoded default attributes for each individual Allied Character.  Still need to bust
	  these out into a parsed text file for easier modification by non-programmers.
	+ Modified display of confidence bar, so that bots who aren't retreating always show a small sliver 
	  of green. (Tweaked GetBotRetreatLikeliness in aimain.c)

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added "Help Team" command - selected medics will heal the team, selected field ops
		will give the team ammo
	+ Added bindable hotkeys for "Help Team" and "Hold Position", and added default
		binding for "Help Player" - default to 'h' for help player, 'i' for hold pos,
		and 'j' for help team.
	+ Removed hotkey binding to bring up bot command menu, which is no longer needed.
	+ Finally found and fixed bugs with "Heal Team"
		- Medic on low autonomy wouldn't go anywhere to heal team - bumped up range will travel to heal
		- Injured medic on ammo crate would repeatedly give self heath packs and not pick them up
		- Injured medic NOT on ammo crate would pick up own health pack and not help team anymore.
	+ Per request, medic and field op can only use hand guns now - no more thompson.
	+ End stats screen now shows player kill count and headshot count (used OSP stats)
	+ Added tracking of bullets fired and missed shots -- stats screen now displays accuracy as well.

			TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
	+ stubbed BotImport_DrawPolygon in dedicated build

10-01-2003
			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Tweaked cigarette smoke.
	+ Bots now have a notion of aiState(alertState) - relaxed, query, alert & combat. 
	  This is a much expanded version of the old alertState, which was broken to start with.
	+ Hooked in many aiState-based animations including relaxed idle and relaxed walk.
	+ Don't play the sneak animation (cover spot animation) while in combat.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Heal squad command will now have medic heal self as well.
	+ First pass at soldier heavy weapon commands (icons not in yet)
		- Panzerfaust will shoot the weapon at a location or target of your choice
		- Flamethrower and Mobile MG42 will cause the bot to cover the area you target
			with that weapon.
	+ Bots no longer update their cursor icons, which was unneccessary, since they have
		no UI.
	+ Added 1st pass at end stats screen - if you create a trigger
		classname = multiple_trigger
		ainame = player
		target = endmap
		When the player points at it, they'll get the screen from SP that shows endgame
		info, time in level, objectives completed, etc.

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Modified Health and Name positioning for bots in SP to try to stay over the head of the bots
	+ Tweaked retreat code to make it not factor WIMP_FACTOR in twice, and 
	  made a bigger "safe area" around BJ for bots.

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>		
	+ Changed various texcoord array assumptions to use two texcoords arrays now instead of a single interleaved one
	
09-01-2003
			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Limited distance of bot action icons, so you can't look ridiculously far ahead, and
		find enemies you can't even see by the bot attack icon.
	+ Slowed down rate at which you can use knife, so there's a longer pause
		in between each knife attack.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Cigarette smoking code is in (through cigarette on/off script command)
	
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added cg_polybus.c, and reworked tess to be able to use swap in arrays for rendering, instead of static buffers. 
		- (also allows passing of normals in now! :))
		- WARNING: the buffers must NOT be cleared until after the trap_R_RenderScene is called, or the buffers may(WILL) not have used yet.
	+ Modified atmospheric effects to use polybus, for testing.
	+ Changed various non-precahced images to be pre-cached.
	+ Fixed some sounds being stored as global ints rather than in the media_t struct.
	+ Fixed fireteam commands not being throttled.
	+ Fixed redundant calculation being done 10 million times in commandmap rendering, (1 / ( cmmaxs - cmmins )) now calced at map load.
		- changed all code to use * invdist instead of / dist as well
	+ Stopped flamethrower doing silly frustrum clipping of polygons, and added a pointandradiuscull check instead.

---------------- Mad Doc BUILD 09-01-2003
09-01-2003
			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com.
	+ Bots disarming mines will now disarm more than 2 at a time, and will only
		disarm detected mines in the area.
	+ Bots trying to pick up health packs will now "hit the use key" when close,
		so they can pick up packs on top of crates and such.
	+ Fixed bug where if you set reaction time on a bot to a few seconds,
		they'd never fire.
	+ Bots won't go prone in combat if an enemy is nearby.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ stamina items (item_stamina_stein and item_stamina_brandy) now work.
	
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added new surfaceparm "SURF_LANDMINE" accessible via shaders as
	  "surfaceparm landmine." This surfaceparm is the ONLY way now for surfaces
	  to be mine-able now.
	+ Added frustum culling to foliage instances. Worst-case scene on mp_wurzburg
	  now has ~15k fewer triangles.

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed a bug with navigation code that got bots stuck on things like crates.
	  They were getting the wrong areanum from "BotPointAreaNum" which returned 
	  the area from a region offset by half the bounding box of a character.

08-01-2003
			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Activate cursor hint for mg42 will not be shown if already mounted.
	+ Bot mountgun action for mg42 will not be shown if gun is already mounted.
	+ Properly display cursor hint when mousing over bot_seek_cover_sequence trigger
	  (it was blocking other entities)
	+ Properly display cursor hint when there are more than one invalid entities 
	  "blocking" the view ("blocking" in terms of tracing code)
	+ Allies bots always fall back when they die so that it smoothly transitions to
	  the fallen (sitting-up) animation.
	+ Fixed the swinging blade problem in temple map when it's destroyed.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Retreat revisions: Bots will try to move through cover spots as they retreat
		back to the player
	+ After retreating, a bot will not re-engage for a set amount of time
	+ Being healed will immediately take a bot out of the retreat behavior, and
		allow them to engage again.

07-01-2003
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed missing UI dlight export (wtg yd)
	+ REF_FORCE_DLIGHT now works--dynamite will light regardless of r_dynamiclight 0

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ When a bot is ordered to heal another bot, the one being healed will stop,
		crouch, and wait for medical attention if not in combat.
		In combat, they'll keep fighting, but won't move to a new seek cover spot.
	+ Medic bots can now hold up to 6 syringes.  They still default to starting with 3.

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Put new default values in for Allied and Axis bots for bot attributes, including
	  reaction time, aim accuracy, fire rate, and damageratio.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Player's name is now "BJ" instead of "wolfplayer" in single player game. wolfconfig_mp.cfg
	  is not touched though, but in every other way (score board, the name that appears when
	  player issues a command to a bot, etc.), the player's name is "BJ".


06-01-2003
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Made console/engine use gfx/2d/consolechars instead of hudchars

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bot retreat revisions - took out random factor, so when they break and retreat is based
		on their wimp factor, and changed it so if they are really "scared", they just break
		and run for the nearest safe spot, not the player.
	+ Health packs don't respawn in SP unless the respawn flag is checked.
	+ Follow leader revisions so they don't oscillate between following in a line
		and seeking cover every time you take a few steps in any direction
	+ Fix to bug in following code where a bot that was supposed to be following in a line
		(not seeking cover) could decide to use a bot that was seeking cover
		as its direct leader
	+ When a bot without a weapon picks one up, they'll actually use it now.
	+ Fix to bug where medics wouldn't pick up their own health packs when ordered to
		heal themselves
	+ Bots no longer can use disguises - it's going to be player only.
	+ Player can pickup disguises.
	+ In SP, dropped weapons contain a random number of bullets.
	+ When a bot finishes disarming a landmine, it'll look for another and keep
		disarming.
	+ Bots ordered to Move to Location will walk when they get close to the target.

			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Adjusted camera shake code to actually shake the camera, not just tilt it
	+ Patch to game(bg) anim/sound loading code that was causing an exception in MP
	+ Removed vertexDlightBits copy pass from bsp drawsurface renderers (it was doing nothing)
	+ Added frustum culling to foliage, cuts down foliage verts/tris by 15-20k on worst-case scenario
	+ Removed references to vertexLightmap, shrinking shader struct
	+ r_lightmap 1 now shows lightmaps on all surfaces (if 2nd pass, blended using GL_ONE, GL_ZERO)
	
			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Meals (item_health_turkey & item_health_breadandmeat) now work.
	+ Added civilian bots (through SetCivilian command).

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Made it so bots won't choose a cover spot that someone else is sitting on
	+ Bots going to a cover spot (already chosen) will stop if the player is sitting there
	  instead of circling like madmen.

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed sun rendering not preserving the modelview matrix stack
	+ Added r_debugSurface 3 (in conjunction with bot_debug 1), to enable viewing of ALL AAS areas in a map (up to a max of 4096)
		- WARNING: this is VERY VERY slow, due to the silly way in which the areas are being stored/transmitted for rendering
		  i'll clean this up soon if i get the chance

03-01-2003
			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Stubbed out download stuff in VC 6 projects.
	+ Modified combat seek-cover stuff to keep bots from advancing out of movement range.
	+ Made follow and seek cover ranges tighter to the player.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Hooked in a bunch of death-related sounds from original SP including body dropping,
	  meingut, heifer. Also mixed up the various death sounds where appropriate.
	
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Dlighting fixes/optimizations
		- Bmodel entities now dlighting correctly
		- Optimized dlight surface culling code based on transformed bbox - surface spheroid
	+ Console
		- Commandline completion now indented 2 chars instead of 4 to line up
		- CC now dark gray to differentiate between other console text
		- CC cvars now display their values in cyan (quick shortcut to see cvar values)
		- New console font image to replace the crappy Copperplate Gothic illegible nonsense
	+ LibWWW
		- removed hard-coded paths from linker & preprocessor in wolf.vcproj

02-01-2003
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ General fixups for MV rendering
	+ Upped MAX_ENTITIES_IN_SNAPSHOT from 256 to 512.  The server can send up to 2k, and the engine can parse
	  this many, but for some reason, it was clamped to 256.  MV can routinely send 270+ per snapshot, so this
          was causing blink out issues.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed the body "shift" when axis bots die (one of the death animations is bad)
	+ BJ now has the "correct head" in 88mm (and a few other maps)
	+ In SP, bots can pick up any weapons they can be spawned with (not just those weapons
	  that they already have).

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Medics don't autoheal in single player
	
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Dlight fixes
		- Fixed dlight bug in limbo/single player menu
		- Homogenized dlight culling based on origin/radius/aabb
		- Fixed long-standing bug where certain triangles would be dropped from being dlit
		- Boosted gun dlight brightness
	+ SF_FACE == SF_TRIANGLES now (brush face surfaces are no longer special cased internally)

02-01-2003
			TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>			
	+ BotGetTargetExplosives declared in g_local.h broke gcc build, bot_state_s undeclared
		the only outside usage is for g_bot.c, move the full declaration of BotGetTargetExplosive to ai_main.h
		left a GetTargetExplosive wrapper in g_local.h

	begin wwwdl stuff ---------------------------------------------------------------
	2-1-2003
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ pre-compiled Debug and Release libs for libwww, took out the direct dependency to libwww projects
			have to checkin updated .vcproj files to SOS		
		+ catching all alerts / interactive prompts for aborts now (traced a ftp hang on win32 to a missing interactivity handler)
		+ changed cl_downloadName so that we print the URL (it's too big for the screen though, will have to toy around)		
		+ hook developer 1 to WWWTRACE = SHOW_ALL_TRACE for debug builds
		+ tests:
			- passworded ftp download
			Cvar_Set2: sv_wwwBaseURL ftp://login:pass@host:port/path
			- lenghty download on big file
			connection with server stays up
	
	1-1-2003
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ isolate the dl init to run only once, add various state flags in client download subsystem to check good use
		+ hooked up progress alerts and library prompts, file download overwrite to yes, aborting otherwise
			progress reporting: block -1 also sends file size, libwww sets cl_downloadCount
		+ running tests:
			- 2 pk3 downloaded in a row + successful server join in
				
	31-12-2002
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ fix win32 build
		+ error condition when loading a document: using the status of HTRequest terminate handler to tell error/success
			we used to look at the status of HTEventList when it ends, but that's bogus information
		+ testing "wwwdl fail", two situations:
			- download fails to init (i.e. DL_BeginDownload returns an error)
			- something fails in the middle of the download
			client sends a wwwdl fail right after the wwwdl ack, and waits for a new gamestate from server
			(but stays in the 'www downloading' loop state, as I didn't find any other way)		
		+ for test runs on win32:
			server:
			$ ./ET.exe +set dedicated 2 +set fs_basepath C:\\home\\Id\\ET-basepath +set developer 1 +set sv_allowDownload 1 +set sv_wwwDownload 1 +set logfile 2 +map mp_railgun
			see cvarlist *www* and sv_allowDownload cvars
			client:
			$ ./ET.exe +set developer 1 +set fs_basepath C:\\home\\Id\\ET-cl +set cl_profile TTimo +set r_fullscreen 0 +set logfile 2 +connect 192.168.1.4
			see cl_wwwDownload etc.		

	30-12-2002
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ moved the dl_events.c code to be directly in libwww HTEvtLst.c
		+ static linking of libwww on Linux
			we wrap autocrap code inside a cons script
			multiple .a are a living nightmare, cyclic references are causing unresolved
			building a single libwwwdl.a by extracting and relinking everything between libwww and our own code - Conscript-dl
		+ added sv_wwwCheckPath code - basic tests ok on Linux
		+ setting lib behaviour to non-interactive (avoids failed prompts)
		+ adding support for wwwdl fail message, server fallbacks to regular download if client sends a wwwdl fail
		+ successfully downloaded a file via login/pass ftp
		+ client has cl_wwwDownload CVAR_USERINFO, server uses to decide wether to start a www download

	28-12-2002
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ test autodownload stuff with mp_bin:
			server: (sv_allowDownload sv_wwwDownload sv_wwwBaseURL etc. must have been configured as CVAR_ARCHIVE already)
			rm ~/.etwolf/etmain/mp_bin* ; ./wolfded.x86 +set fs_basepath ~/Test/et +set developer 1 +map mp_railgun
			client: (always run #2)
			cp ../auto-pk3/mp_bin.pk3 ~/Id/media/incoming/web/foo/etmain/ ; ./wolf.x86 +set developer 1 +set in_nograb 1 +set fs_basepath ~/Test/etcl +set cl_profile TTimo +connect 192.168.1.4
		+ last dl_events.c update broke the Linux version (at runtime)
			switching to static build and linking on Linux

	27-12-2002
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ more test stuff to server files
		+ also http://abyss.sourceforge.net/ for server stuff
		+ design for basic download functionality:
			sv_wwwDownload general server toggle to redirect
			sv_wwwBaseURL the base URL to use and construct
			don't force all the files to be mirrored, check that the file is present first? (err we can't do that)
			so if fails client sends 404 and we try a legacy wwwdl
			we'll need some userinfo on the client to turn off the download redirect maybe (in case the client doesn't support?)

	20-12-2002
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ checking in libwww code, static linking on win32 with some new .vcproj files
			The library will need to be stripped down, right now we have everything in (including gother, telnet, http..)
		+ win32 static linking caused several problems, due to aliasing of the dl_event.c code rewrite.
			Prefixed everything with DL_ and things seem to work fine. Be careful when using though.
			WWW_WIN_ASYNC code functional, had a successful connect / download / reconnect client sequence on win32
		+ added Com_VPrintf( const char *fmt, va_list argptr); (used for HTTrace)

	19-12-2002
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ work on the server side. libwww doesn't have much available to serve filesystem
			worked out how to have a non-preemptive server loop running (solved some blocking select() system call issue in event loop)
			test/listen.c test/listen-serve.c test files for serve stuff
			still need to write the server part to serve the files through http (more or less from scratch - duuh)
		+ porting to win32 - need a customized reference source tree + static libraries (only the relevant subset)
			using libwww-5.4.0 package
			took out gnu_regex and xml dependencies
			#define WWW_WIN_ASYNC 1

	16-12-2002
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ wrote a custom libwww event loop from libwww app samples to perform a non-preemptive http download
			client inits and iterates through the download
			had a client connect to server, perform a download, and enter the game
		+ several new files and file naming reorganisation for the download stuff in qcommon/	
		+ note about libwww event loop:	
			There is a default event handling loop in libwww. Heavily platform dependant, and preemptive.
			We need to get rid of preemption. We could work on a custom pseudo-threaded loop, or do true threading.
			True threading doesn't sound good. Cross-platformness bustage is likely, and it's harder to put together.
			(so I went for pseudo-threaded / iterative)

	13-12-2002
				TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
		+ negociation of ftp/http download
		+ very basic wwwdl prototype:
			- basic server use case: extended the svc_download stuff so that server redirects to an URL (hardcoded for now)
			- basic client use case: acknowledge wwwdl, proceed, send a done download
			- builds on Linux only. very basic hook up to libwww
		+ tag trunk as wwwdl-tag	
		+ branching and saving to wwwdl branch
		+ tagging this checkin as wwwdl-1 (as in, step 1)
	end wwwdl stuff ---------------------------------------------------------------

01-01-2003
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Added a "Demos" menu to select and load demos
	+ Added a "Demo" section to the control menu in the default UI.
	+ Upped demo file list from 4kB to 30kB (people tend to accumulate a lot of demos over time)
	+ Small fix for a key bind in demo playback
	+ First post of 2k3!!

30-12-2002
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Centalized cgame keycatchers to properly allow for demo keycatcher override
	+ Added thirdperson viewing option in demos (from wired key binds)
	+ Added demo control info overlay (togglable on/off, with an option to disable entirely)
	+ Fix for avirecord info in demos
	+ Disabled extraneous menu popups while viewing a demo
	+ Removed ready up command info during warmup for demos and spectators
	+ Cleanup of some client info cvars and extraneous inits

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added terrain-specific modifiers to SP bot hearing code.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Made a general "Help Me" hotkey - if you have a medic selected, and you're dead,
		the medic bot will revive you, or heal you if you're alive.
		If field ops bot is selected, he'll give you ammo.
	+ Made "Help Me" and "Follow Me" bot hotkeys bindable.
	+ Don't display rank of teammates in single player, it's not really applicable.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ New animation code for seek cover spot. Soldier model currently has this new animation.
	+ No idle animation while proning/crouching.
	+ Death while prone now uses the right death animation (axis bots only)

28-12-2002
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Small fixes for multiview (scoreboard and CovertOps updates)
	+ Small tweaks for pub/comp mode settings
	+ temp fix for NULL returns in BotGetEntity() for the MP bots.  Looks like goal.entitynum is going out of
	  range for some reason, so I just put in NULL checks to ensure the game module wont crash when bots are
	  running around.  Look for the FIXME markers in botai/ai_dmnet_mp.c to see what's been checked.

27-12-2002
			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Axis bots will drop their weapons when they die, even if they are set to
		disconnect.
	+ Made an explicit command to order bots to use ammo and health crates.
	+ Draw crosshair for player when leaning in SP, take lean into account
		when doing trace for bot commands.

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bots in SP followleader will get a speed bonus in catching up to the player bonus
	+ Removed (hopefully) redundant call to ClientBegin for bots.  Keep your fingers crossed!
	+ Added useful programmer art debugging tool (cg_drawCats).

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Body in SP will play the last frame of the death animation (so it won't flip from
	  the last frame of the death animation to a completely different frame)
	  
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Upped the limit for models, both for brush based entities, and model2 styleeeee
	+ Fixed bug with script_movers causing them to set aas data as blocked constantly even if moving, 
		as trDelta is never being set, changed to a check for trType == TR_STATIONARY for now, 
		will probably want to expand that later (Make railgun ALOT less jittery, were getting spikes of 90ms+
		inside the game dll, i imagine the atvi test server would feel it even worse)
	+ Hacked around timothee's fix for edit box text going outside of its bbox for 0 width edit boxes (name edit on limbo menu)
	+ Wondered wtf that cg_drawCats cvar does
	+ Upped version number to 2.10f (yay i get to do it for a change ;))


26-12-2002
			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Ammo items now work again.  You can place ammo_45cal etc in Radiant, and it will
		appear in game, and can be picked up.
	+ Fixed bug where you could shoot an Axis bot in the back, and he'd say.
		"I thought I heard something".
	+ Bots can see a wider view through binoculars than players,
		which means they can detect mines more easily.
	+ Fixed endless loop if you commanded a bot to cycle weapon and it had no
		weapons.
	+ When you are in the Listen Up part of "Listen Up/Go go go", an icon now appears on
		your screen.  For now, it is VERY temporary.

			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Silenced weapons that are fired do not cause enemies to hear them
	+ Bullets shot from silenced weapons into bodies do not alert hearing system,
		although ricochets do.
	+ Move-out-of-the-way code has been added to FollowLeader AINode.
	+ Added a random factor the the footstep hearing code.
	
24-12-2002
			Ian <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Slightly modified SP corpse behavior.  Xinbo will need to help with animations.
	+ Added MoveOutOfTheWay functionality for bots.  Only hooked up to AINodeStand right now,
		but it's very sexy.
	+ Added error reporting to SetBotAttribute if you specify an attribute that doesn't exist.
		(Before it would just get stuck on that line of the scripts).

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Retreat behavior revisions, make them more likely to break and run.
	+ Added a "Morale" bar to the bot display, which is how likely they are
		to break and run.  When it gets below half, they're pretty likely to come
		running back to you.
	+ Bots don't play idle animations while doing a scripted DeliverMessage command
	+ Don't display number of air strike cannisters for Field Ops bots anymore

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed a couple of problems with bot selection number assignment
	+ Added bot name above selected bot popup command map.

23-12-2002
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoother.org>
	+ Fix for mouse sensitivities under multiview
	+ Fix for some time-based skill ratings and their interaction with match pauses (MP)

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bot Follow Leader revisions, so there's some randomness in when they crouch
		and break for cover, hopefully making it look less like an aerobics class.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Displayed the lose condition countdown on screen.
	+ "Death" script event will be properly invoked if the bot is killed for the 
	  second time (after being killed first and then revived).
	  
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed bug in building the hash table lookup in r_cacheshaders 1 causing all manner of weirdness.

22-12-2002
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoother.org>
	+ Merged the callvote and rcon menus into a main menu definition with context menus
	  available for players, referees, rcons.  ingame_rcon*.menu files are no longer needed
	+ Added all possible callvotes and nearly every referee command to the cv/ref UI
	+ Added/tweaked a couple of existing voting options (updated createserver.menu to reflect
	  these updates)
	+ Moved a couple of things over to menudef.h, so you'll have to resync the etmain/ui assets
	  tree to make a build.

20-12-2002
			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Players never gib in single player games
	+ Players do not respawn in single player games.
	+ Headshot does regular (no extra) damage on allied players in single player games.
	+ Turned off friendly fire in single player games.
	+ SP now use large med pack (previously unused), with a updated heal value of 50 points

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Removed airstrike command for allied SP bots
	+ Changed bot HUD behavior - if you cycle to a command, that command will
		remain selected as long as it is valid.
	+ In SP, player always gets binoculars
	+ Allied bots automatically pickup ammo items like syringes, diguises,
		smoke grenades when they can use them and they're nearby
		
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Removed a bunch of old tesla-related code from cgame
	+ Rewrote dynamic lighting code
		- dlights are vertex-attenuated, not cylinder attenuated
		- radius & intensity are separate, so you can have bright small lights and dim large lights
		TODO: Fix dlight culling code to use sphere/sphere tests

19-12-2002
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Several menu tweaks/bugfixes
	+ Fixes to multiview to actually make it work :()  Still some work left to do to incorporate all of
	  the new features of ET from RtCW, but it is now functional.
	+ Several weapon stat fixes

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Tweaked aim code.
	+ Fixed the problem where sometimes BJ talking head animation does not work.
	+ Added script command "SetFireCycleTime" to allow scripters to tweak fire rate related code.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Axis bots in the same squad will now trigger each other's enemysight sections,
		so if one bot in the squad sees an enemy, they all will hit the enemysight section
	+ Made SeekNonBattleGoal in SP take travel time into account again
	+ Bots can no longer be added to the same squad multiple times (one bot was taking
		up several spots in the squad).

18-12-2002
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Cleanup of some of the console-based gametype voting
	+ Fix-up for some map_restart commands based on the current gamestate (the state transition checks
	  *in the engine* place an undo constraint on the mod code and really should be gutted).
	+ Removed "tourney" from serverinfo and pulled the mostly deprecated g_noTeamSwitching cvar from the
	  engine (another cvar that should be ultimately controlled in mod-space).
	+ If a listen server, local client is always at least a "true" referee
	
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Speeded up visible surface finding when -forcesidesvisible is set in bspc (basically free)
	+ Tweaked some other bspc code for smaller speedups
	+ Fixed cg_fastSolids to work with the flamethrower, still need to fix it to use bbox extents, not just origin
	+ Enabled cg_fastSolids and cg_backupPredict by default
	+ Added axial early out to assembly version of BoxOnPlaneSide, as a wrapper for the moment, perhaps implement in assembly too if required, 
		fixes slowdown on shooting entities (in debug, on win32)

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Changed bot aim code for single player -
		bots now shoot in a zig-zag pattern left-right right-left pattern
		crouching/prone bots shoot better and make enemies miss more at the same time
		eliminated twitchiness for shooting bots

17-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage>
	+ Fixed long time bouncy artillery smoke bug.
	+ Fixed getting skill points for killing dead bodies.
	+ Fixed spawn grenades.

			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Added speclock checks to jump to freefloat from followmode as a spec
	+ Various console printing cleanups
	+ Small fix for health/adrenaline info shown for following spectators

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Made SP weapons placed in editor WITHOUT respawn checkbox NOT respawn
	+ Made SetAmmoAmount function work with ammo and health packs use "AMMOKIT" and "MEDKIT as weapon name
	+ Fixed problem where bots sometimes couldn't open doors when commanded to
	+ Tethered bots to player a bit more so they don't get as far away from the player in combat situations
	+ Fixed bug that caused bots to run backwards to old seek cover spots far away from the player
	+ Fixes to Recon command so bots will not attack while on Recon, and definitely
		won't break out into full battle fight/seek cover behavior
	+ Changed ammo table so engineers start with several dynamites, so can
		complete maps that need it (like 88mm)
	+ Don't cause all enemy bots to disappear in SP when a engineer destructible appears for the enemy.
	+ Don't play idle animations in cinematics.

			Tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Took "delay" parm out of spawnbot (unused)
	+ In SP, make satchel charge covertops weapon, and show ammo amount in bot display
	+ Draw disguise icon for bots which are wearing disguise. NOTE: really bad placeholder art. I'm using
	  the axisUniformShader, but it's so small that you can't really see what it is. either we need new art
	  for the bot display, or we need to rearrange the selected bot info to display it.
	+ Send botteam message every time from squad select, not just the first time. Allows fireteam changes to take
	  effect

			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added variable console heights. Small (3 lines) is shift+`, and fullscreen is alt+`
	+ Fixed HOM when cg_skybox is 0 and r_fastsky is 0 (now draws clear color)
	+ Purged all evidence of r_vertexlight from the code
	+ Warn on unsupported hardware (Rage Pro, Permedia, Riva 128)
	+ r_ignorehwgamma now set to 0 by default (prefer to use hardware gamma support)
	+ Purged last of r_fullbright
	+ r_shownormals are now 0.5 units rather than 2 units, easier to see normals on viewweaps
		
			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Eliminated global variable d_player in cgame and updated all codes using it. It
	  is not being updated properly and has caused problems.

---------------- BUILD 035 - 2.10e (etmain)

16-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Satchel charge and detonator no longer make the covert ops player lose his disguise.
	+ Added grid rendering to the commandmap and automap.
	+ Fixed weapon idle animation not set properly in CG_Respawn (no togglebits).
	+ Some tiny more skill system bits.
	+ Started using MDM and MDX models for the allied and axis players again. (MP only)
	+ Upped version number to ET 2.10e.
	+ Added adrenaline syringe animations.
	+ Fixed having a mortar emplaced not setting any animations on the player.

			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Centralized the auth (referee and rcon) system for players, cleaning up some var names
	+ Centralized the enable/disable of voting items.  g_allowVote has been deprecated, and
	  g_voteFlags is now a ROM that is also a ServerInfo cvar that clients use to dynamically
	  update their UI.  It's also a cvar for server browsers like GameSpy/ASE to pretty
	  print if they so desire
	+ Completely revamped the voting UI in regards to enable/disable, current server settings,
	  and the player's auth status.  Still have to centralize callvote/referee/rcon into a
	  single set of menus to ease future updates.
			
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added variable rain amounts to atmospheric code
	+ Hacked in lightning for mp_colditz (test)
	+ Disabled texture compression on external lightmaps
	+ Added glTextureMode support for lightmaps

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Set damage dealt ratio through script command to modify the damage inflicted on the enemy
	
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added misc_cabinet_health and misc_cabinet_supply entities, to link to trigger_heal and trigger_ammo respectively
		in order to display a visual feedback for the triggers
	+ Tweaked the recharge rate of the trigger_heal/ammo
	+ Fixed health pickup sound
	+ Removed the right-click fireteam menu
	+ Fixed crash in MDX code
			

15-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Skill system revision stuff...
	+ Added some tracemap failsafes and warnings.

			Ian <Ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Made BotCallForHelp more likely to get guys to run in
	+ Made a separate list of autonomy ranges for SP

14-12-2002
			Ian <Ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added accessor BotGetDamageRatio to get a modified damage ratio (based on dist to leader)
	+ Added accessor BotGetAimAccuracy to get a modified Aim Accuracy (based on dist to leader)
	+ Fixed bug in getting initial cover spots in which targetLocation wasn't set
		if we were using a scripted cover sequence.
	+ Added parameter "NONE" as option to Bot Script function SetCoverSequence.  This clears that field for bot state
	+ Added a check for FindEnemySP into Battle_Fight so that we could switch to a better enemy if one comes up
	+ Made BotCallForHelp more likely to get guys to run in
	+ Made a separate list of autonomy ranges for SP

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added script function SetAmmoAmount so can set how much ammo a bot has for a particular weapon,
		or how many syringes, smoke grenades, etc. it has.
	+ New bot command to pickup an item, when you have a medic selected and
		mouse over a syringe item, you'll get the grab icon and they'll run over
		and pick it up.
	+ Bots now only play their idle animations when you've been looking at them
		for a few seconds
	+ Fixed bot throw smoke grenade cmd, which kept throwing until you ran out
		of grenades
	+ Added hotkey for cmd "Follow Me", currently bound to 'k' (nothing's free!)

13-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Changed crosshair health to default to off.
	+ Wooo. Skill system revisions \o/.
	+ Got rid of holdableValue in usercmd, replaced with cgameflags. We're not using this but might be nice for mods.
	
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Merged Admin and Referee functionality.  The callvote/ref/rcon menus still need some work to add in
	  all of the new votes/commands that are available.
	+ Cleaned up some 50 or so release-build warnings (still over 700 remaining :p)
	+ Fixed cg_drawWeaponIconFlash 1 functionality

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ When bot is hit by friendly fire, he will play move animation while moving out of the way
	+ Scaled weapon hit knockback way down for single-player.
	+ Hooked in the death animation from head wound.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Moved all wimp factor constants into ai_distances.h
	+ If leader stands still for several seconds, following bots will seek cover
	+ Allied bots won't use their enemy's seek cover trigger
	+ Added VO for when allies retreat to the player
	+ When moving to seek cover spots, bots don't count the time moving as time
		at the spot (so they stay at spots a bit longer)
	+ Fixed crash whenever you gave bots a non-combat command

12-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Moved ui_mp to ui.
	+ Removed activateable items.
	+ Skill system revisions!
	+ Upped UI mempool to 1.5 megs, due to the large amount of menu scripts we were running out of memory.
	+ Fixed callvote menu.
	+ Fixed damageRatio affecting non-player entities.
	+ Reduced skill system to 4 levels.
	+ Added support for translucent command map.
	+ Made cg_drawTimer work again.
	+ Fixed out of ammo sound on mortar when it is not really out of ammo.

			Ian <Ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added variable enteredCurrentAINodeTim to bot state so some nodes (the new SP retreat) can avoid thrashing.
		This must be set manually by each node's Enter function.
	+ Added BotFindEnemies to ai_dmq3.c to create a list of all dangerous enemies (for retreat AAS purposes)
	+ Put together AINode_SP_Retreat to handle Nazi retreating behaviors
	+ Wrote AAS_Retreat to 1) Flood Fill AAS data with distance from dangerous nodes, and 2) Find a safe node to go to
	+ Put in a dumb, inefficient Priority Queue to test functionality of AAS_Retreat (I need to switch to a heap). 
	+ Made all SP AINodes use AimAtEnemySP.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Removed more unused vars from bot_state_t
	+ Made reaction time scriptable once more - use SetAttribute BOT_REACTION_TIME <secs>
		to set how long it takes for bots to start firing once enemies are spotted
	+ Player issued attack command now uses new battle code, so they won't just run up
		to their enemy any more.
	+ Added NEVER_PRONE flag to seek cover spots, used at the end of a seek_cover chain,
		if the last spot is in a tight position and they shouldn't go prone there if cornered
	+ Made axis and allied seek cover spots different colors in Radiant
	+ Added new attribute BOT_WIMP_FACTOR, from 0-1, likeliness bots will break and retreat
		Used by Allied bots to see if they will retreat to the player
		Retreating factors in bot health, distance from player, if the player is visible or dead,
		as well as the wimp coefficient
	+ Added RetreatToPlayer node, so allied bots will run to the player if they wimp out,
		and if that fails, they'll use generic retreat code

			Tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added new ammo pickups for smoke bomb, smoke marker, landmine, dynamite, satchel charge, and disguise for single player. Put in
	  really bad placeholder art (random models), and added to wolfet_entities.def
	+ In single player, bots don't hear knife attacks. Also, I had to make it so that they don't feel them, either: otherwise they would turn around
	  and attack you as soon as you stabbed them once, making a silent attack pointless. That can kind of suck, if the player only stabs the 
	  bot once: it'll just stand there.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed a bug where movetomarker script command does not work if bot is doing "faceentity"
	+ Pain animation is now dependent on the position of the hit and there are a variety of them 
	  (8 standing ones, 3 crouching ones, no proning one). No pain animation is played in proning
	  position (the bot used to "stand up in pain" :-) while hit in prone position)
	  
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	 + Fixed thinko in DeathmatchScoreboardMessage
	
11-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Disabled stealthy footsteps in MP.
	+ More skill system revisions.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bots no longer switch out of fight node to go back to following (where they'd promptly switch to the fight node again)
	+ Fixed bug in follow code where in balcony situations (xpbot_museum), a group of following bots couldn't
		decide who was the leader and would just keep running back and forth.
	+ Fixed bug where ammo packs stopped working
	+ Moved item pickup display out from under bot HUD, so player can see what items
		they pick up (only moved for SP)
	+ Moved notification text so it isn't under bot HUD
	
			Ian <Ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Inited DamageRatio for entities at a different place (it was being wiped after scripts had set it)

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Enclosed coverage map history code in COVERAGE_MAP_DEBUG. 
	+ Added mu_queue and mu_fade script commands.
	+ If the bot is in pain (playing pain animation), he can not think (no firing, moving, etc.)

			TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
	+ Linux: fixed cons build to support LINK, forced to gcc for smallest dynamic dependencies (ccache addition had broken that)		
	+ add mp_bin.pk3 generation

10-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ More skill system revisions.

			Ian <Ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed bug with bots at most advanced seek cover spot not retreating if shot
	+ Fixed bug with advancing through cover spots not checking all siblings properly
	+ Fixed bug with cover spot's targets being the 0 string finding unnamed spots.
	+ Removed lingering bot squad hiding stuff that is no longer used
	+ Lengthened time that bots will stay at spots with exposed companion spots
	+ Fixed bug that made them immediately run out to the exposed spot (made you amIHiding start true)

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added stealthFactor (aka noisyness coefficient). The lower the number, the 
	  harder it is for the enemy to hear the player/bot walking, and the lower the 
	  sound volume of footsteps. Current setting is:	   
			Soldier (most noise)1.0
			Engineer .6
			Medic .5
			Field Ops .5
			Covert Ops (least noise) .2
	+ Allies soldier has a couple of new idle animations

			TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
	+ #577 - merge in free fly spectator code
	+ don't reset the enterTime during a map_restart (ATVI Wolfenstein Misc #414)

		Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Made use of exposed flag on seek cover spots, so bots will move between a spot
		and a neighboring exposed spot when attacking
	+ Fixed some of the hide/attack issues with attacking from cover spots that
		caused the bots to bob up and down in a ridiculous manner.
	+ When at a prone spot, bots will crouch to attack, not stand all the way up

09-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Started revision of skill and rewards system.
	
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Fixed MG-42 stats bug in warmup
	+ Minor bot fixes for match play
	+ cgame update to support windowed scene rendering.  Note, if you add stuff to be drawn in
	  CG_DrawActiveFrame that utilizes the current cg.refdef data, please utilize the cg.refdef_current
	  pointer instead.  If you add a subroutine that is to be called from DrawActiveFrame, please also
	  update CG_mvDraw() in cg_multiview in the appropriate place.

			Tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ In SP, the player can pick up weapons dropped by enemy bots (regardless of his class)
	+ SP now uses the same compass/map and expandable automap as MP

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Enabled alternative idle animation for allies bots (better animations are being made though).
	+ Idle animation for bots in follow leader and cover target mode.

			TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
	+ propagate configurable voting system. Merging with Rhea's OSP voting.
		each vote is using its own vote_allow_ item on game side, mapped those to a bit mask
		due to higher number of vote flags and issues with initialisation:
			using 32 bits and setting bits to 1 for forbidden votes
			set g_voteFlags to -1 for no votes
		new createserver.menu, ingame.menu, ingame_callvote.menu
		TODO:
			missing ingame votes for votes configured in createserver
			need special case for referee
			start_match doesn't have a toggle flag, present ingame, always allowed to be voted
			reset_match is listed ingame, but is not recognized as a valid vote (disabled for now)
			the detection of no vote is very minimal, should rely on what can actually be voted. but the ui is in (error_popmenu_novote)
	+ CVAR_ARCHIVE'd g_motd
	+ Linux: added ccache support (faster, faster, faster!)

		Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ First pass at allied bot battle code - they should now use seek cover spots where available,
	+ Made improvements to the allied bot knife wielding code, so they should actually run up to
		their target(if within autonomy range), and not just swipe at them from afar
	+ First pass at allied bots supporting their teammates, so if one of them gets
		into combat, they other bots won't just stand 10 feet behind them and
		ignore the combat

			Ian <Ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Set up new batch files in source code SOS under "Tools\Binaries\ExtractEntities" for compiling
	  with the extractEntities executable that pulls out the AI-specific entities to cut the entity count.

08-12-2002

			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Added bot settings to create server menu
	+ Minor fixups for some match state handling

			Ian <Ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ SP Bots at their last cover spot on the chain will go prone if shot
	+ Removed 25+ unused variables from the botstate

07-12-2002

			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ UI fix for focus issues on a fast cursor that would miss the call to the item's mouseLeave script
	+ Fixed another UI focusing problem when a group is terminated
	+ "Create Server" .menu updated. There are new 5 sections: General, Match, Voting, Admin and MOTD.
	  Lots of cleanup and change of flow to the .menu
	+ Added some additional game cvars to the ui_main.c for proper mapping in the create server menu


06-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Forced autoreload on for bots.
	+ Made lastlerporigin and lastlerpangles work.
	+ Made mortar grenade align to its trajectory properly.
	+ Changed mortar soundcode.
	+ Added snd_reload, this reloads all soundsfiles that are in memory from disk.
			
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com> <ydnar@shaderlab.com>
	+ Sky rendering optimizations + fixes
		- Added alphaGen wave noise support (it was broken, causing a DROP error on access)
		- Fixed (changed, this was weird) code in tr_sky.c that was stuffing one vert per stage of a sky shader,
		  changed to only push one set of verts to tess
		- Added RB_CHECKOVERFLOW to sky rendering to accomodate > 2 sky shader stages reliably
		- Optimized portal sky rendering. Skybox rendering no longer walks the entire BSP, saving 1-2 frontend msec per frame
		  (sky portals are now limited to 32 BSP leaves, so don't use structural brushes!)
	+ Added generic culling counters to see effectiveness of new culling code (enable via r_speeds 2)
	+ Shaders can now have implicitMap/implicitMask/implicitBlend instead of explicit shader stages
	
			TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
	+ #577 - url/mod_url functionality, ET theme for urls.menu
	+ #577 - flamethrower cheat (aim at your feet) - G_BurnMeGood
	+ #577 - ATVI Wolfenstein Misc #462 - sv_punkbuster trigger dependent on what core says
	+ #577 - vsprintf -> Q_vsnprintf to fix many potential overflow crashes
	+ #577 - IP banning fix - idcvs/2002-August/000223.html
		and Xian GUID-based maxlives enforcement - seems functional but cl_guid is not effective atm
	+ Linux: using ~/.etwolf, renamed window class to 'Enemy Territory'

			Tara <tara@maddocosoftware.com>
	+ First pass at Follow leader revisions so they spread out and seek cover depending
		on if the leader is running, crouching, prone, etc.

			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Fully synced weapon stats to the ET arsenal.  +wstats/+wtopshots/weaponstats should now all
	  report accurate info.
	+ Cleanup of some client cvar flags sent to the server
	+ Various visual tweaks for new OSP features

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added [history] option to console command "CoverageMap". It only works in development
	  mode, and it displays coverage map data from the last 10 sessions of this map. The color
	  it displays at each covered spot depends on the frequency this spot has been covered over
	  these sessions.
	+ Fixed hurt/death/pain sound playing for allies.
	+ Tweaked smoke bomb/bot vision code (something must have changed with the underlying smoke code) 

			Ian <Ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Renamed server entity special files from .txt to .cat to avoid them loading in notepad all the time.

05-12-2002
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Merged in final components for game (g_main.c)
	+ Merged in final client components in cgame
	+ Major OSP integration is complete.  I still have a number of small items remaining
	  due to differences between ET and RtCW, but the bulk is now in and tweak mode
	  begins.  I'll put together a doc that outlines all of the new commands and
	  variables for both server-side and client-side.

			TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
	+ additional TODO for #577:
		- merge in free fly spectator stuff
		- propagate MG42 prediction (Arnout)
		- Q_vsnprintf everywhere
		- IP filtering fixups
		- ATVI Wolfenstein Misc #414 (conflicts with current stuff) - don't reset the enterTime during a map_restart
		- Xian GUID-based maxlives enforcement
		- URL / mod_URL
		- drop airstrike and join spec
		- flame thrower cheat, run and fire at the ground
	+ fixed EV_FIRE_WEAPON_MG42 playing MG42 sound twice
	+ Linux: libGL.so.1
	+ update serverinfo.menu/error.menu to match ET color theme

			Ian <Ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added explicit reloading check to Battle_Fight SP AINode.
	+ Checked scriptAutonomy in Battle_Fight to make sure we're allowed to chase enemies.
	+ Added botscript function "SetCoverSequence" which should specify the name of the first cover spot in
	  a sequence for the bot to use.  This overrides any sequences set on the enemies.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added SetScriptAutonomy script command, let's you set if bots will break out of
		their current command to attack the player.  See BotScriptCommands for details

			Tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added lockpick weapon (WP_LOCKPICK). Just placeholder art and stuff.
	+ Made new key value KEY_LOCKED_PICKABLE to indicate that a door is locked but can be picked. Key value in editor is set as 99 to indicate
	  that the lock can be picked. 
	+ Fixed up CG_CheckForCursorHints(). Basically just turned a huge if-then-else statement into a switch for readability (and to help
 	  me find some mismatched brackets).  
	+ Added HINT_LOCKPICK

04-12-2002
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Merged in the remaining OSP server-side updates (minus some match state in g_main.c)
	+ Added autoreload to pmext (from RtCW 1.4) + supporting functionality
	+ Removed deprecated cg_emptySwitch
	+ Final mass-updates will be all cgame (today/tomorrow)
	
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com> <ydnar@shaderlab.com>
	+ Added "cycle" cvar command: To use, bind a key to cycle a cvar, for instance:
	  /bind backspace "cycle r_speeds 0 3"
	  The command is in the form of cycle <var> <min> <max>
	  It will cycle a cvar's integer value from min to max, then loop back to min.
	+ Global Q3 _fog volume now sets clear color and z farplane
	+ Refactored map drawsurfaces to have homogenous header
		+ New drawsurface culling code in renderer front end, treats SF_FACE, SF_GRID, SF_TRIANGLES
		  and SF_FOLIAGE the same way, doing frustum culling, backface/plane culling
		+ Added 5th frustum plane (farplane)
		+ BSP/marksurfaces recursion now uses frustum farplane for culling
		+ Drawsurface culling code uses same
	TODO:
		- Use homogenous surface information for dlighting
		- Implement runtime shadow frustum occlusion using same

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added coverage map, which displays what parts of the map have been explored.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed problem where SP games would restart when a Nazi died and there were
		no Axis left on the map.  This bug also caused cinematics to repeat themselves

			TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
	+ updated from SOS, fixed Linux build for newly added files
	+ show_bug.cgi?id=577
	  1.33 -> 1.41 merge work into ET
	  have core code and ui merged
		merging in new ui scripts - built ui.patch with only the changes to ui scripts
		reordering ingame.txt load order for correct draw order
		patched error.menu serverinfo.menu, urls.menu is new
		
		TODO:
		- hook up voting system in game? (check with Rhea)
		- hook up auto-update dialogs
		- hook up auto-reload in controls
		- sv_punkbuster trigger dependent on what core says (ATVI Wolfenstein Misc #462)
		- massive createserver.menu update with voting conf
		- the ui for server info / error and urls is not matching the ET color scheme
		- the server info fails to retrieve if local server (?)		

03-12-2002
			TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>
	+ show_bug.cgi?id=577	
		applied src patch, going through the diff and fixing
		ignoring diff parts to ui scripts (main/), cgame and game
		updated pb to what I have in 1.4
		NOTE: WINDOW_MODAL in ui/ merge .. conflicts with WINDOW_DRAWALWAYSONTOP? are they same functionality?
		merged all menus into ui_mp/ingame.txt, load from a single file (was required for some menus to be common to ingame/menu)
		
	TODO:
	- update the ui scripts content
	- go through the diffs again, candidate ui changes
	- go through cgame/game diff, see what stuff we'd need to patch in now, and what can wait

			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Merged in the bulk of OSP serverside code (update your game projects with new sources)
	+ Most new cgame commands and windowing now functional 
	+ New server commands and voting options available (nothing in the UI yet)
	+ Small tweak to the controls menus
	
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com> <ydnar@shaderlab.com>
	+ Added native support for external lightmap images in this form:
	  "maps/<mapname>/lm_NNNN.tga"
	  Invalid or out-of-range lightmap indexes attempt to load an external lightmap
	+ Added tr.worldDir for external lightmap support and future BSP extensions

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed the problem of bots playing death-like animation under certain situations
	  (such as scripted to play an animtion right at spawning) when they should play
	  a good animation.

---------------- BUILD 034 - 2.10d (etmain)

02-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Moved tracemap code to bg_tracemap.c, server now also loads the tracemap (FIXME: optimize loading, now reads byte by byte - this is slow)
	+ Mortar implementation finished.
	+ Added mortar hud.
	+ Upped version number to ET 2.10d.

			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Changes to SP AINode_SP_Battle_Fight stuff:
		* Nazi bots will tend to move forward unless they've been shot recently
		* Improved bots' claim on cover spots (refreshes claim time more often)
		* Bots in "Crouch" spots will stand and shoot periodically
		* Bots who are standing and shooting in "Crouch" spots will duck if shot
	+ Changed fire rate stuff for bots to be more natural (bursts are more common)
	+ Condensed the million and two checks for enemy death into single function: BotIsEnemyDead

			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com> <ydnar@shaderlab.com>
	+ Fixed envmapping. Works correctly on rotated entities including first-person view weaps
	  Re-transforming reflection vector from model space to world space via partial linear subset
	  of inverse modelview matrix
			
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Fixups for demo playback
	+ Added a colored background round timer w/optional reinforcement timer to the right

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added script command StartLosingCountDown and ResetLosingCoundDown.
	
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed crash in BSPC after CM_LoadMap, relating to uninitialized memory
	+ Fixed BSPC treating all surfaces with patchheight/width as patches, not checking the surfacetype
	+ Added frustrum culling of temporary marksurfaces (player shadows for example) for a little speedup
	+ Moved parsing of skybox parms out to a seperate function

01-12-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Increased ammo for GPG40 and M7 to 8.
	+ Started base implementation of mortar.

			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ The bulk of the OSP-based client-side options are in place, including the cgame windowing
	  system and Multiview spectator support.  However, anything that isn't local won't work
	  until I get the server-side support rolling
	+ Added 2 new files to the cgame.dsp: cg_multiview.c and cg_window.c
	+ controls.menu update
	+ Server MOTD support in place for client viewing during connect

30-11-2002
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ More UI updates with additional client-side configuration options.  Also rearranged
	  some of the item locations for better grouping of similar option types.  Cleaned up
	  some of the formatting as well.

29-11-2002
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed compile errors (missing semi-colons) in g_combat.c

			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Changed atmospheric effects and tracemap generator slightly to ensure rain stays outside.
	+ Added new satchel charge sounds.
	+ Satchel charge now gets removed on teamchanges and disconnects.
	+ Fixed getting a second satchel charge if you died when one was already placed in the world.
	+ Changed the way spawnflags work on func_explosive and func_constructible entities. With the Dynamite / Satchel spawnflags set, such an entity can be damaged by dynamite and satchel damages, respectively. Similarly, the Explosive spawnflag controls vulnerability to other explosive damages.

			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Added tooltip info, a new crosshair configuration section, and other new "view" settings
	  to the options/ingame_options .menu files
	+ Support for several of the above settings added to the menus is now active (however,
	  crosshair coloring won't show up until Arnout can get the proper shader updates that
	  I am sending to him OOB of SOS).
	+ Added random reinforcement offsets, dictated by the server.  Also enabled clients to view
	  reinforcement times on the HUD with cg_drawReinforcementTime.
	+ Added match_warmupDamage to allow for damage settings in warmup.  0 = none (default),
	  1 = enemies only (and self), 2+ = anyone
	+ Began server-side updates for MP pausing (level.timeCurrent, level.timeDelta)
	+ Initial merging of server-side match states
	+ Support for new local client commands: autoScreenshot, autoRecord, currentTime, and +vstr	

			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com> <ydnar@shaderlab.com>
	+ Multiplied wolf fog by identity light for more consistent fogging on levels, irrespective of the state of overbrighting

28-11-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed hud drawing if client was spectator.
	+ Changed give ammo to only give ammo for weapons the client has.
	+ Base implementation of satchel charge.
	+ Changed automap in MP to use its own X and Y coordinates.

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added cg_backupPredict which should speed up prediction when enabled, as it caches old predicted playerstates so it doesnt need to rebuild them all the time
	+ Added cg_fastsolids which should speedup prediction when enabled, by only treating entities as solid if close enough to the player
		- Note: this has some side-effects with the flamethrower going through walls, etc., so it's likely that we don't want to enable this, or have flamethrower code ignore this
	
27-11-2002
			Jason <rhea@OrangeSmoothie.org>
	+ Added support for "tooltip" attribute in UI .menus for popup contextual information on
	  menus/items (will begin adding .menu updates for various config/voting options)
	+ Support for a few more in-game menu items (i.e. voting and blackouts) that will be added 
	  in a forth-coming update
	+ Ported over a couple of other bg components that were needed for the ui updates, but
	  will also be needed in the game/cgame modules

			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Modified SP Battle_Fight to cause bots to start shooting when they reach a new cover spot

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Toggle auto map on and off with F8.
	+ Fixed a problem with stopgamemodelanimafterloop where the game model started again
	  after it is stopped if you go away and then come back.
	
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com> <ydnar@shaderlab.com>
	+ Added r_drawfoliage cvar
	+ Re-enabled dlight-leaf checking

26-11-2002
			Randy <ydnar@splashdamage.com> <ydnar@shaderlab.com>
	+ Added new foliage rendering system (MST_FOLIAGE/SF_FOLIAGE)
	  (fixme: write documentation)
	+ Added level-wide Q3 volume fogging (supported via Q3Map2) in worldspawn "_fog" key
	+ Optimized Q3 fog code for eye-in-fog case
	+ Fixed shader loading bug where a shader request with an invalid lightmap id (< 0)
	  would bork all future valid lightmap requests of said shader
	+ Fixed console wrapping to wrap to screen width (not 640 pixels)
	+ Added new cvar r_clampToEdge to substitute (the desired) GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE from GL_CLAMP requests
	+ Added shader fix where explicit lightmap pass in shader gets set to *white + CGEN_EXACT_VERTEX
	
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added scripting command "SetSpeedCoefficient" to adjust the speed of individual bots in SP

			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed capsule collision detection with patches, problem was caused by code not being merged properly from TA.
	+ Fixed predicted, local client jittering across commandmap/automap as it wasn't using the lerpOrigin.
	+ Changed rain to use the optimized atmospheric effects code. No impact marks anymore though.
	+ Removed atmospheric effect configstring, moved it to clientsided parsing.
	+ Added BG_AddMagicAmmo to bg_public.h.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Expanded the usefulness of "nowait" option in "playanim" script command. It is possible
	  to play different animations on legs/torso through the use of "nowait" option.

			Tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Hooked up new single player art for automap: now has square map embedded in round art, and the compass icons are again
	  drawn around the circle in the art.
	+ Don't display bot stamina bars
	+ Adjusted selected bot display to compensate for taking out bot stamina bars

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added POW (prisoner of war) AI, basically short circuits various AI behaviour nodes, and stops the guy from tapping out/being totally killed
	
25-11-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Made MDS and MDM set their surfacetype on load, instead of being dependant on what the model compiler provides us.
	+ Rewrote a lot of the atmospheric effects code for snow (still have to move it over to rain). Runs much faster now, no traces being used anymore and early-out culling.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Smoke from smoke grenade (smoke bomb) now blocks bots vision

			Tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Hooked up the rest of the special weapons to use ammo in SP
		
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Reworked fireteam to allow leader to select specific command to send to clients, + added in support for all/most sp commands

22-11-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added tracemap generator - will be used to optimize atmospheric effects and add other effects.
			
			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Can no longer pick up ammo packs when ammo is already at maximum
	+ Changed sound spatialize code to oberve the law of conservation of energy
	  (attenuation, however, does not obey physical law for now). This makes the total
	  sound volume to be no longer subject to the direction of the sound, i.e. people
	  speaking right in front of you will not sound further away than people speaking 
	  on your left or right at the same distance.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ props_statues can now be destroyed with bullets

21-11-2002
			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added "syncsound" option to playanim/playeranim
	+ Added "stopsound" script command.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added FaceEntity script command
	+ Added FireAtTarget script command from SP codebase
	+ Bots will now go stand on ammo and health crates when they're close by
		and need to use them
		
			Tim  <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Took out old obsolete script commands BotPool, StartingSquad, RequiredClass, and MaxStartingBots and all

		itoa is not portable, use va instead
		stricmp is not portable -> Q_stricmp

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Put back in props_flamebarrel

	+ updating the code to build again on Linux
	  tagged ttimo.net CVS with pre-ET-sync before fixing
	+ show_bug.cgi?id=574
	  game code references sound subsystem. breaks dedicated server.
	+ show_bug.cgi?id=575
	  union { .. is non portable, must use typedef union { .. } a_union;
	+ MSVCism: matrix functions in tr_animation_mds.c tr_animation_mdm.c are aliasing, made the ones in tr_animation_mds.c static
	
	-- linux / ttimo.net cvs specific --
	+ retired unix/ChangeLog, using the central one now
  	+ Anjuta wolf.prj linked dir line:
		cons.linkeddir=debug-x86-Linux-2.3:unix;release-x86-Linux-2.3:unix;unix/debug-x86-Linux-2.3:unix;unix/release-x86-Linux-2.3:unix;extractfuncs/out:..
		the order is important
			debug-x86-Linux-2.3 at the beginning of the path can happen because of the build system which CDs to unix/
				since we give relative to .prj for the dest dir, use unix
			this situation is kind of hackish. may have to add some path functionality to anjuta-cons stuff
		+ R_MDM_* -> removed tr_animation.c, added tr_animation_mdm.c tr_animation_mds.c
		+ cleaning up in botai/: 
			removed ai_chat.c ai_chat.h ai_dmnet.c ai_dmnet.h

		Only weapon-y weapons are cycled, not medkits, syringes, etc.

13-11-2002
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>

		These commands no longer give packs to the player.
	+ Player can't mount broken MG42s in SP, and won't get the cursor hints for it either

07-11-2002

	+ SetSelectable script command will now properly update the team display in upper left

	+ Another (hopeful) improvement to revive - bots crouch when reviving, maybe helping
		out in those hard to reach places

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Playsound script command now always works regardless of the visibility of the bots.


			Tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>

	+ Updated resources and window creation bits to say "Enemy Territory" etc.
	+ Fixed even more CG_Bullet and CG_CalcMuzzlePoint issues.
	+ Changed console autocomplete to ensure shortest string (this was supposed to be the case as well, but wasn't). This also fixes a crash in the newer autocomplete code.
	+ Changed extended console autocomplete to put the cursor at the end of the completed string as well.
	+ Changed GAMENAME_STRING to "et".
	
			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>

04-11-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Made the HIGH spawnflag on MG42s actually work. MG42s without this flag will have their muzzle point 16 units lower then. This fixes the "MG42s are hitting the ceiling for no obvious reason" bug.
	+ Rewrote flag code to work properly with multiple flags.
	+ Upped version number to ET 2.10a.
	+ Removed skill requirement for disguise.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added SND_NO_ATTENUATION flag. Used it for bot chatting over radio with the player.

		of their vision
	+ Fix to another few cases of endless ainode switching
	+ Another few artillery fixes - one if you tried to call in 2 artillery strikes
		in a row, the 2nd might not work, and if a bot was following you and
		then told to artillery, in some cases it might try to call the artillery
		at your feet
	+ If you give a move order pointing at a cliff with different slopes,
		the move point will now be dropped all the way to the ground

			Tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Player spawns with default class weapon (in single player). Bots do as well, unless /weapon specified in spawnbot call.
	+ "Talking Head" bots centered by tag_mouth if present, otherwise hacked in to be centered. In the future, there will be an appropriate
	   tag put into the head models so we can center the talking head camera properly.
	+ Added Journal section to mission briefing screen. It's a scrollable buffer, with two buttons. I did it the dumb way (copy strings backward
	  when full). Will do it the right way later.
	+ In single player, Open Limbo Menu now displays the mission briefing. You can now go into and out of the limbo menu properly in single player.

03-11-2002
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Major revisions to Avoid Danger behavior...
	---> Reduced Airstrike danger range to 550 from 1500.  That was just too big
	---> Added minimum time to stay away from danger for airstrike (bots could
	     decide to run back between shells
	---> Fixed serious bug in AAS_AvoidDangerArea that didn't init "inlist" flag
	     properly.  This caused good routes to be cutoff.  I'll have to check
		 if that is a systemic problem in other AAS calls.
	+ Single Player bots now hear bullet impacts.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added optional param to god cheat cmd - \god all will make all your bots

	+ Merged new model formats (MDM and MDX) from branch.
		
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed MG42 manning bug (guys didn't drop the gun).

	+ Added BotVoiceChatAfterTeamIdleTime to allow some VOs to be "team mediated"
	+ Added farSeeingRange which is the distance at which your guys will say "Spotted Enemy"
	+ Fixed bugs from revisions of BotFindEnemySP that made bots not shoot much.
	+ Now that bots are really using vision and hearing in SP, I added a real bs->persistentEnemy
	  so they'd give chase if you got out of their view...

			Tim 	<tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ In single player, instead of a compass, draw the compass icons around the minimap. Kind
	  of like putting a square peg in a round hole...
	+ First pass at putting talking heads in for selected bot.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Axis bots on MoveToMarker or Stand will whirl about when they hear enemies, and if they
		don't see them on their spin, they'll go back to previous action
	+ Bots without a weapon will no longer request ammo

		to that spot when done with a task
	+ Reorganized Bot command menu (Hold Pos is now at top level)

		spot a mine, disarm a mine...

	+ Fixed bugs in new "spawning" of bots

---------------- MAD DOC BUILD 10/28

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed up the artillery bot command - they should now actually call down artillery
		on the spot you're pointing at
	+ Started putting in VO hooks - now if you ask bots to airstrike/call artillery and
		they don't have enough "energy", they won't try to airstrike, and when we get the
		sound files, they'll tell you why
	+ Added SetSelectable script command, so you can spawn bots on your team that you
		can't select and give orders to
	+ No SP bots should ever use grendades now (since they tend to kill themselves)

27-10-2002

	+ Fixed another infinite loop switching between AI nodes (battle and chase)

			Tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Upped the number of missions per campaign to 10

25-10-2002
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Allied Bots in SP will now never Gib or fully die (the new design has just a fixed "dirty half-dozen"
	  buddies for you, and they never really die in the story, but get "revived" between missions).
	+ Added new weapon: WP_SINGLE_PLAYER_AMMO.  Gives out ammo packs like WP_AMMO, but Field Ops only
	  have 6 of them and can get more at ammo recharge stations.
	+ Added new weapon: WP_SINGLE_PLAYER_MEDKIT.  Gives out health packs like WP_AMMO, but Medics only
	  have 6 of them and can get more at ammo recharge stations.

			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Ported eye blinking code.
	+ Fixed doppler.
	+ Made music/audio fade-in in level work properly. The engine sets volume to 0 on level start, it's up to gamecode to fade it in (rockandroll).

	+ Changed 'queuemusic' to 'music_queue' to still allow for quit autocompletion on q.
	+ Changed hunk_alloc in snd_setup to malloc (like in TA code). This seems to stop memory corruption with compressed sounds. (Need to find the real problem though.)
	+ Removed SetTeam from clientconnect, was setting and doing a whole lot of things it shouldn't. Replaced by the bare essentials.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Cover That command is now working with the icon interface
	+ Covert Ops Detect Mines is now properly showing up where available w/icon interface

	+ Merged WolfSP sound code in.
	+ Merged loopSound code from TA in.
	+ Added facial animation.
	+ Added '/ah [on|off]' command to spawnbot. Setting '/ah on' means the code will expect the head to be animated and suited for facial animation.
	+ Removed need of an entitynum for looping sounds.
	+ Bumped max looping sounds to 1024 (A single flamethrower was already taking 40-odd-ish)

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Possible fix to bots circling each other when large group given a MoveTo command
	+ Minor fixes to revive, might be easier for bots to get to bodies now

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Activated application of radio static to clean bot sounds.

	+ engineers with critical tasks (building/destroying) should be used as priority leaders

15-10-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Changed BotAllocateClient to accept a clientNum parameter so you can allocate a prefered clientslot (needed for savegames).

	+ Made sure bots get the classname "bot" instead of "player" or undefined.

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed bug where Lieutenants and Medics would try to avoid the bot/player they were giving ammo/health to, causing a mad crazy dance.

	+ Added: last tinfo per team is now buffered, and server will not send them if no change detected, tinfo is now sent per team, not per client
	+ Reverted score servercommand back to an earlier design, but can now overflow into a second servercommand if it hits the limit on the first one

	+ Fixed SP AI crash when no profile exists.
	+ Fixed light weapons always getting a 10% damage boost instead of only when you have the right skill level.

			Tim  <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added a bunch of new script commands for specifying what is available on the squadselect screen. (MaxStartingBots, PlayerClass, StartingSquad, ClassRequired 
	  and BotPool).

	+ Rewrote some of the limbomenu etc backend, the left and right hand panels are now sperated totally, and can be shown independantly 
		(need to check squad setup still works ok, as it's panels are still non-indepdant, and will/should likely stay that way)
	+ Fixed limbomenuy not displaying when going into limbo
	+ Added display of medals and rank in team overlay

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>

	+ Added some debug code to simulate lag (not functional yet).
			
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Removed bot formations.  Bots now follow in single file line, and the line
		should reverse if you run backwards along it
	+ Multiple bots will not try to use the same seek cover spot
	+ Scripted MoveToMarker commands will now always set the bots' autonomy pos,
		which fixes a bug where they'd run back to their spawn point as soon as
		they were given their freedom
	+ Lieutenant bots no longer call for ammo

	+ Lt and Medic bots should heal/give ammo to themself even if they are standing still now.

	+ Fixed bug in G_Damage that caused anything that called the function with attacker == inflictor not being able to gib entities. This caused script_movers to get stuck on dead bodies. (Need to backport this to 1.4 if pos.)
	+ When moving in prone, guns don't switch to (invisible) prone hands anymore. Instead, they can't fire anymore and slightly move lower down the screen (and the side).

	+ MP40 changed, now exactly the same as the Thompson.
	+ Stats and medals are now saved in session cvars if it's not a forced map_restart.
	+ Changed 'g_warmup' to default to 30 seconds for ET. In Campaign Mode and LMS it uses the double of this cvar for warmup time.
	+ Rewrote WolfReviveBbox, players should be way less likely to get stuck when being revived now. Needs a lot of playtesting to make sure though.
			
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>

	+ Fixed spawn settings reseting if brought up after set but before respawn

	+ Stopped remapshader command from writing the configstring (was causing server to send the rather large configstring 4 times on forest, causing the server to stutter and lag all the clients), have to use the remapshaderflush command to do that now
	+ Unified animation code for gamemodels/movers
	+ Added ability to vary the volume of looped sounds (target_speaker, with volume key/value (255 is default, max 65535)), or with a playsound X looped volume Y script command

		placeholder and will be "Enemy Spotted" or something like that.
	+ Fireteam selection command is now implemented.
	+ Restructured bot command menu to correspond to design.

	+ Fixed pmext clearing breaking binoculars animation.
			
20-09-2002

	+ Changed timing on MG42 prone animations.
	+ Changed the way maxammo works, now uses BG_MaxAmmoForWeapon so it can be changed based on skill level.
	
			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>

		enemy within autonomy range
	
19-09-2002
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Had to init bs->weaponnum in BotAI to match the weapon the bot spwaned
	  with; otherwise, it would frequently not fire (thinking it was mid-weapon-change).

			Tara	<tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added first pass at Lieutenant bots calling in support fire.
		You can command them to call in an Air strike or Artillery.  Sometimes.
	+ Can order engineer bots to Plant Mine.  If pointing at bad terrain (indoors

			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added notion of follow distance, which is how far a bot should be from

	+ Fixed bug where ComeToMe (GoToPlayer script command) wasn't working quite right

			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added PlayAnim to Bot scripting.

			Tim	<tim@maddocsoftware.com>

	+ Don't display objective flags in single player

17-09-2002
			Tara	<tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bot command for Covert Ops "Get Disguise" is implemented.  If you have a covert

	+ Added selection box, fireteam, keypad, and better-fitting name to new sp team overlay

			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ Stopped lieutenent throwing air-strikes without appropriate command
	+ Fixed nav bug
	+ Fixed clipweap causing bspc issues

16-09-2002
			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bot menu is now context sensitive.  If you have a medic selected, you'll see Medic! and Revive!,
		if you have a Lieutenant, you'll see Air Strike (not all commands are implemented yet)
	+ Implemented the revive command, so a selected medic will go and revive the corpse of an ally that you
		are looking at.
	+ Added another mechanism for storing menu hotkeys - previously, could only have one binding for a hotkey on a menu, 
		so even though you might have a 2 commands that don't show up at the same time, by using the cvartest system, 
		you couldn't have a hotkey for each.  Now, you can have hotkeys associated with each menu item, and if you set 
		the itemHotkeyMode to 1 on the menu, then you read in the hotkeys for each item, and have to loop through every
		item in the menu to find the appropriate hotkey

			Tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added new single player only team overlay, using icons instead of text to show info. Currently have bot face, weapon and movement autonomy,
	  ammo count, name and health. More to come.

			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Bots prone when player prone
	+ Menu command to make bots prone

12-09-2002
			Xinbo <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed the problem with body disappearing right away (and sometimes reappearing later).
	+ Make the axis dead body start sinking in 5 seconds.

11-09-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Started implementation of flailing arms and legs.
	
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Limited medic revives for SP, per request.  Made the medic (is SP) play a VO saying they're almost out when down to 3 or
	  fewer syringes.
	  
			Tim	<tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Rearranged the controls menu. Added a new category "Bots", and moved all bot-related commands into there. Did the same for the
	  ingame controls menu. Also moved the bot command menu from the quickchat onto its own key.
	+ Added new spawnflags to Touch_Multi(), allowing class-specific triggers

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Stopped noclipping players being able to halt movers
	+ Added an svFlag that disables bounds checking for a bmodel type entity for PVS calculations, just uses origin instead (BE CAREFUL WITH THIS, can only really be used in combination with fog, or entity could just pop into view)
	+ Added "useoriginforpvs" option to set svFlag SFV_IGNOREBMODELEXTENTS on bmodels set using setmodelfrombrushmodel script command
	+ Added "nonsolid" option to create non-solid bmodel using setmodelfrombrushmodel script command
	
10-09-2002
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ In SP, grows FOV for bots when enemies get closer.

			Tim	<tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Changed how Bot_ScriptAction_SetWeapon() works. Before it was setting a number related to the weapon which was used later in SetWolfSpawnWeapons().
	  Now it verifies that the weapon is legal for the team/class/weapon combination, and sets the exact weapon. I added a new func, SetAbsoluteWolfSpawnWeapons(),
	  which is similar to SetWolfSpawnWeapons(), but it doesn't make any assumptions about which weapons should be added/equipped. It adds all of the
	  non-primary weapons (grenades, medkits, etc), but actually equips the exact weapon asked for.
	+ Added "GotoWaypoint" (Bot Menu) to controls->chat options menu

---------------- BUILD 028 - 2.00u (missionpack)

09-09-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Removed respawn queue messages from LMS.
	+ Fixed lieutenant message in voicechat scripts.
	+ Added 'No complaint was filed' message on complaint cancel, gets send to the TK-er.
	+ Removed unused teamscoreboard and scoreboard spectator mode from code.
	+ Removed BotGameIsSinglePlayer from botlib again, functionality was already there as Export_BotLibSetup is called with a singleplayer flag.
	+ Made Tim's change from 06-09 SP only.
	+ Changed FG42's firing rate when scoped to be the same as other sniper rifles (400msec).
	+ Added player rank to crosshairname.
	+ Made mounted MG42s use historical traces.
	+ Upped version number to Wolf 2.00u.
	+ Added team specific respawn point icons.

08-09-2002
			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added ability for botlib to check for singleplayer (Re: tim's comment 06/09) botimport.BotGameIsSinglePlayer, just links directly to the server check
	+ Added "setposition" script command to move an entity directly to a path_corner
	+ Added "setmodelfrombrushmodel" command to set the model for an entity to that of a func_brushmodel

---------------- BUILD 027 - 2.00t (missionpack)

06-09-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Sounds for a constructible that is really a mover (like the tanks) now play on the trigger_objective_info.
	+ Added repairmg42 scriptcommand.
	+ Fixed smoke grenade ending up in a solid causing an infinite loop.
	+ Added knockback on slick for Mobile MG42.
	+ Prevented dynamite and landmines from bouncing whenever stationary.
	+ Undid 'Changed commandmap to display on death and when player presses limbo key'.
	+ Upped version number to Wolf 2.00t.
	
			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ Checked in bspc fixes. Note: mp_forest requires clipping work and possible further bspc fixes.
	+ In "standstill" mode, don't look for other goals if already in stand() node.
	+ script_mover entities now block areas when stationary.

			tim <tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Allow a bot to have no weapon selected in single player. NOTE: BotValidWeaponNumber() to allow 0 as a valid weapon number, but wasn't able
	  to restrict it to missionpack and single player, because the botlib has no notion of either things. If it causes a problem down the road
 	  I'll have to find a better solution. It's just a sanity check, though, so it *should* be ok.
	
05-09-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed flickering during mapload. Reason was that just before loadmap was called the screen was cleared and between the loading of lumps the engine forces an updatescreen. Interesting issue, if you turn on r_clear 1, the actual levelshot doesn't seem to be rendered at all (altough it passes through the backend to the OpenGL drivers).
	+ Fixed allied 2 minute and 30 seconds warning (backport from 1.4).

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ re-added the TNT explosion spawnflag on target_effect entities, gives the dynamite explosion instead of the puny little grenade one
	
04-09-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Lowered sniperrifle recoil by 50%.

			GStrawn <gstrawn@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ prevent bot health from counting down to 70 (i.e. don't set STAT_MAX_HEALTH = 70)
	  This was caused by the bot's handicap being set too low.  The "handicap" should 
	  probably affect something other than the bot's max health.

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added target_explosion entity, for nice flying rubble effects *cough*
	
03-09-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed target finding for misc_constructiblemarker (doh, stupid bug).
	+ Fixed patches clipmodels being broken outside 4096 unit mins and maxs.
	+ Applied map_maxbounds to polylib (consistent with TA exe now).

02-09-2002
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ misc_constructible_markers were trying to g_Find the targets
	  on creation, but sometimes the target hadn't been loaded yet,
	  so it was failing to find it.  No need to find the target then.
	+ Modified bs->idealviewangles to not cause bots to stare at the
	  floor or ceilign when standing...
	+ If MoveToMarker fails due to bad AAS data, it now drops the
	  bot into STAND, so that they'll respond to enemies, etc.
	+ Fixed timing bug with allied bots running away from dynamite.

			Tim 	<tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added hotkey for selecting bot to team overlay. Transmit info from client 
	  to server via player configstr and store in clientinfo for that client. Note:
	  we need to find a solution for displaying this key if the user binds the
	  functions to another key (how would we display, say, TAB, and how would we
  	  localize it?)

---------------- BUILD 026 - 2.00s (missionpack)

01-09-2002
			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Tweaked distance explosion sound range for grenade launchers.
	+ Added animation to binoculars weapon.
	+ Added campaign description to campaign overview screen.
	+ Fixed .campaign file parsing in cgame.
	+ Added campaign support as gametype to the create server menu.
	+ Added teamwins to campaign overview screen.
	+ Added stat and medal saving and restoring for sessions.
	+ Upped version number to Wolf 2.00s.
	+ Fixed SP campaign menu.

			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed putting movespeed thing in wrong place (engine side). Doh.
	+ BJ says "MOVE" when you give a movetoloc command.
	+ The presence of FOG on some maps caused the SP allied bots to
	  not shoot at the enemies.  It also caused the names of the bots
	  and the bot_debug data to not show up.  Fixed this.
	+ Bots in FollowLeader who were seeking cover spots had their
	  local variable "target" uninitialized, and this caused them to
	  run backwards or sideways, so I fixed that.
	+ Gave speed bonus to covertops Bots in single player.
	+ Modified Seek Cover spots part of FollowLeader to compare the
	  seek cover spot against the position of the leader to see if
	  it was too far away.
	+ Had to put in a new way of giving bots a speed bonus once
	  g_movespeed was moved to bg_pmove.c.  See the function 
	  "GetBotWalkbonus".
	+ Fixed bots on MoveToLoc turning backwards from time to time...

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added ability to force the selected spawnpoint for a team via script "forcespawn <spawndescription> <team>" where team is the usual 0 = axis 1 = allies
	+ Changed commandmap to display on death and when player presses limbo key
	+ Added display of rank and class of spectated player
	+ Fixed 2D elements not being displayed behind voicechat
	+ Added auto-spawn button on commandmap

			Tim 	<tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added display of bot movement and weapon autonomy in team overlay (in single player only)

31-08-2002
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed manual targetting of destructibles and constructibles by bots to look at the
	  trigger_objective_info and suss out whether to build or blow from the target.
	+ For SP changed the distance an engineer has to be from a target to plant dynamite to
	  be bigger, as the AAS info is frquently trashed by the mere presence of the trigger and
	  objects that need to be built there.  This will need tweaking from time to time.
	+ In SP, Axis bots have unlimited ammo
	+ In SP, Allied bots have unlimited syringes
	+ SP Limbo menu lets you change weapon w/o class change (this is an extension of the hack from 8/30).
	+ New cvar "g_movespeed" affects the speed of the player and the bots (in SP only).
	+ Put in new Class specific Selection and Acknowledgement VO.  This makes it clearer who is
	  getting orders (or being selected).
	+ Removed bunches of MP-related bot chatter.
	+ Fixed movementautonomy position not being updated properly when bots given direct orders
	  to move to a spot.  May be other similar instances...I'll keep my eyes open.

			Tim	<tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Changed bot debugging cvars to only be registered in a single player game
	+ Added movement autonomy to bot debugging
	+ Added weapon autonomy to bot debugging
	+ Added last 3 script statements to bot debugging
	+ Don't let Axis Lieutentants use airstrikes in single player

			Gordon <djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added ability to play animations with ET_MOVERs
	+ Added ability to not have a random start frame for ET_MOVER/ET_GAMEMODEL animations
	+ Added ability to not run through all the animations between a current animation and a new animations( actually, why would we ever not want to do this????)

30-08-2002
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ BOTS: Allied Bots in Single Player now move slightly faster than the player so they can keep up.
	+ Bodies in SP stick around a bit longer
	+ BOT SCRIPTING: Increased number of distinct Bot Scripts available to 256 from 64 (note: this is not
	  tied in any way to entity counts or clients...we could have only 6 bots at a time alive, but need 100
	  distinct scripts over the course of a level.
	+ (This is hacky pending total revision of squad selection and setup for SP): Changed how SetTeam works
	  to allow instant class changes for SP to enable the following to work when you load a map: 
	  Play Cinematic->Setup Player and Squad->Start Mission.  Before this slight change, the player's class
	  was locked as Soldier when the map finished loading.  The hacky thing is that it allows you to switch
	  classes later, too, which is bad, but the whole startup sequence will be reconstructed soon anyway.
	+ Fixed sCheckEngineerTasks to find info_trigger_objectives through a func static associated with them.
	  Designers must add a target to the func_static, and a matching targetname to the info_objective trigger


			Arnout <rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added Last Man Standing mode (g_gametype 5).
	+ Fixed error on map_restart when bot_enable was set to 1 but no aas file was present.
	+ Removed sv_gametype from the engine. Its initialization was causing problems.
	+ Redid serversided campaign loading.
	+ Added Campaign gamemode (g_gametype 4), this is basically Wolf MP with campaign map roulation.
	+ Added 'campaign' (starts a campaign) and 'listcampains' (lists available campaigns) commands serversideded.
			
			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ BOTS: navigational fixes, better movement prediction for direct paths
	+ BOTS: hold position command translates to set autonomy pos, and low movement autonomy. This allows them
		to still function as their class/autonomy permits within a small radius of the hold position.
	+ BOTS: fixed a bug that would cause the bots to not fire at enemies that they should be firing at

29-08-2002
			Tara <tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ If you give a bot a MoveToLoc command at a location, an icon will flash there
	+ Some more infrastructure for enabling bots to build constructibles and mount MG42s

		Gary <gstrawn@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Let the player specify bot targets from across the room.  Simply increased cursor hint range.
	+ Play a sound to indicate that a unit was selected

			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ BOTS: Modified FollowLeader so that bots will move quickly to their seek cover locations
	  unless the crouchtowards flag is set.
	+ Changing start up for single player ot not always got to briefing
	  (not 100% done yet)
	+ SCRIPT: Added the following script commands:
		"CloseLimboMenu"
		"OpenLimboMenu"
		"CloseCampaignBriefing"
		"OpenCampaignBriefing"
	+ Changed G_VoiceTo for Single player not to suppress some
	  commands given to bots.
	+ BOTS: changed BotBattleNewNode to not switch to a battle node
	  if we have a user or scripted FOLLOWME command
	+ G_Damage was calling the "death" section of a botscript once
	  for each "hit" in the death frame.  If you had a flamethrower
	  kill it was really obvious.  This made it impossible to do
	  scripting based on the "death" of a bot, so I made it only
	  call that segment once.

	  
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Moved gametype disabling based on worldspawnflags to g_shutdown.
	+ Made allowteams case insensitive.
	+ Added skin support to misc_constructiblemarker.
	+ Fixed deadcounting for bots (it wasn't counting them).
	
			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ BOTS: navigational fixes on terrain
	+ BOTS: mp_forest tweaks and fixes

			Tim	<tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added bot "thought bubble" debugging. If cg_debugBot is set, you will see the following information
	  when a bot is in your crosshairs
		- current ainode
		- alert state
		- coords
		- current script function.
	  more features to come

28-08-2002
			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ BOTS: fixed origin pointer bugs in BotGetOrigin() and BotGetEye()
	+ BOTS: fixed some follow behaviour issues
	+ BOTS: tweaked bot avoidance code

			Tara	<tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ On the voice command menu, Move To Location will tell your bots
		to do a context sensitive action.  Point at a wall/floor spot, and the bots will
		move to that location.  Point at a friendly bot and they will follow it.
		Point at an enemy bot and they'll attack it.
		Point at a destructible thing, and engineers will dynamite it.
		Basics for pointing at a busted MG42 and a constructible and having
		engineers fix them are in.  Not quite working.

			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Removed hardcoded gametypes from botlib.
	+ Added misc_constructiblemarker entity to be used for the crates etc next to constructibles.
	+ Added waypoint rendering.
	+ Reordered gametypes.
		
			Xinbo	<xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ BOTS: they can be selected with hotkeys (keypad 0-9) and only the selected bots 
	  follow commands. keypad 0 select all bots; 1 fire team A; 2 fire team B; 3 fire team C;
	  4 bot #1; 5 bot #2; ...; 9 bot #6.

27-08-2002
			Tim		<tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added RemoveBot() script command

			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed crash on explosion with non staged destruction constructibles.
	+ Server browser 'refresh' now does an automatic update if there aren't any valid servers in the list.
	+ Fixed mark projection on non-planar planar surfaces.
	+ Reordered gametypes for Last Man Standing.
	
			Gordon	<djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added a slightly cleaner way of doing mounted weapons on movers (attaching player to tag, 
		and forcing movers to ignore the player, no way to unattach yet, doh :o), 
		needs a little bit of finishing off once i get some art assets

26-08-2002
			Xinbo	<xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ BOTS: SetCrouch [On/Off] is working.

			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ BOTS: Added Bot script command SetSleepState [ASLEEP/AWAKE].  This can be used
	  by the scripters to cut off execution of the ainodes (scripting still fires).

			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ BOTS: Added new seek cover behaviour, using placed seek cover spots
	+ BOTS: Fixed autonomy range bug when following player

---------------- BUILD 025 - 2.00r (missionpack)

25-08-2002
			Tim		<tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added PrintAccum and PrintGlobalAccum script and bot commands

			Xinbo	<xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added SetProne [On/Off] for bot script.

23-08-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed "death" for func_explosive getting called twice.
	+ Upped version number to Wolf 2.00r. (Dropped the -MP bit as it's kinda pointless now.)

24-08-2002
			Tim		<tim@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Put SP_trigger_aidoor back in. Just makes sure that door won't close if an entity is touching
 	  the trigger_aidoor. Does *not* tell the AI to move as it did in SP. Only works if gametype is GT_SINGLEPLAYER
	+ Fixed bug with custom accessories on custom models. 
	+ Added the ability to have a custom model have no custom accessory for a given slot (overrides default
	  with nothing)


23-08-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Disabled prone hand rendering.
	+ Started implementing bipod placement animations of MG42.
	+ Added atmospheric effects. Rain is working (needs some extra collision testing, goes through walls/ceilings at times), snow needs redoing.
	
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ BOTS: Fixed typo in g_combat.c that caused compile error.
	+ SCRIPTS and BOTSCRIPTS: added a /N parameter where N is an 
	  integer specifying debug level over which to print the line.
	  defaults to 0, and is compared to a cvar g_scriptDebugLevel.
	+ SCRIPTS: Added function SetDebugLevel <int> to allow the
	  designers to set g_scriptDebugLevel.
			
			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ BOT: Changed health checks so they use scales based on health / maxhealth rather than using a base of 100 health as max
	+ BOT: Bots share enemy information from bot they are following in formation
	+ BOT: Fixes for following player / retreating from enemies behaviour
	+ BOT: Fixed some change node loops

			Gordon	<djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added ability to set AXIS/ALLIED team for script_movers
	+ Added team data to rockets and grenades, for team only damage to movers, need to check other weapons too
	
22-08-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added 'lightmap' command to shaders to load the texture source for a stage. This will load an image as if it was a lightmap.
	+ Added r_lightmap 3, which works the same as r_lightmap 2 but with the blue and red components inverted.
	+ Fixed bulletmarks not appearing in a reliable way.
	+ Changed ui_popup call to not be dependant on the engine doing string->integer translations anymore.
	
			xkan <xkan@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added SetDamageRatio to the script for general entity and bot
	+ Added some code for SetCrouch and SetProne for bot script. it's not fully working yet.
	+ Fixed a compilation error in ai_main.c

			Gary <gstrawn@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Copied in code from old source for mu_start, mu_play & mu_stop.  Reenables music script commands.

			Tara	<tara@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Created a new bot command menu - in single player mission pack
		games the command menu key ('v') will bring it up.
	+ Added command to hold position so your bots will STOP following you.

			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ Added bot entity list for entities that are used only by bots, and are not displayed
	  visually

21-08-2002
			Ian	<ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ BOTS: Added bot script command StandInPlace
	+ Fixed bug in g_initgame that clears botgameentities AFTER it's
	  been loaded, causing it to always be blank
	+ Temporarily removed all entity types from botgameentities
	  until all underlying AI references straight to g_entities can
	  be fixed.

			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Marks now work on SF_TRIANGLES surfaces as well.
	+ Changed bullet impacts to use the normal of the surface as mark projection directory instead of travel directory (resulted in stretched marks).
	+ Added capability of disabling weapons in a script. If done early enough (frame 0 or so) it even prevents precaching clientsided. The syntax is 'disableweapon <weaponname>' with weaponname as in the "weapon_bleh" names. Most weapons can be disabled like this, you should even be able to disable scoped mode from sniperrifles etc.

			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ Fixed ENTITY scripting issue with calling a trigger which in turn
	  called a trigger on the original entity which didn't finish.
	+ Added support for func_constructible entities that block paths when built
	+ Created bot game entity structure to store bot entities, allowing
	  for large numbers of bot helper entities without impacting on global
	  entity limit

20-08-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Reimplemented camera functionality. Scriptcommands startcam and stopcam control it. Due to network load, only functional in SP right now.
	+ Started implementation of marks on SF_TRIANGLES.

			Ian  <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ BOTS: Fixed script command "gotoplayer" to hold script until player is
	  reached.  This makes it play nicer with commands that follow.

			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ BOTS:	Added support for new scoped weapons
	+ BOTS:	Added sniper command (SP)
	+ BOTS:	Added covert ops using sniper when idle
	+ BOTS:	Fixed some sniper issues (MP)

19-08-2002
			Ryan <ryan@gmistudios.com>
	+ BOTS: Added land mine laying (SP only)
	+ BOTS: Added construction (MP & SP)
	+ BOTS: Fixed bots not selecting covert ops (MP)

			Ian  <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed bot scripting commands SpwanBot and SetWeapon to allow specifying
	  weapons with strings, and forcing the selection better (allows specifying
	  KNIFE or LUGER, too).  Using the number instead still works.

16-08-2002
			Ian  <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Added a bot pseudo-hearing/FOV/alert state.  This allows you to "sneak"
	  up on bots.  SP axis bots check to see if anyone near them is engaged in
	  combat, and become "engaged" if so, or if they've been shot.  If they are
	  not "engaged", but are "relaxed" they obey a narrower FOV when choosing
	  enemies in BotFindEnemy.
	+ Added bot script command SetHearingRange
	+ Added bot script command SetFieldOfView
	+ Added bot script command SetAlertState
	+ Fixed a bug with target_script_triggers calling same scripts called
	  from scripting systems "trigger FOO FooScript". See the function
	  target_script_trigger_use.  Old functionality is same, but by using
	  aiName instead of scriptName, new/improved functionality is in.
	  
			Gordon	<djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Fixed various issues with tank markers not displaying correctly, being static, having multiple copies. 
		(NOTE: the whole ET_ TANK/EXPLOSIVE/CONSTRUCTIBLE _INDICATORs is a bit of a mess, might wanna look at cleaning this all up at some point if we have time)
	  


15-08-2002
			Ian  <ian@maddocsoftware.com>
	+ Fixed bug in Bot_ScriptAction_Trigger that kep it from realizing when it
	  had popped back to the calling script.
	+ Added bot script command GotoPlayer
	+ Added bot script command FollowPlayer
	+ Added bot script command SetHealth
	+ Fixed bot script command SetAttribute BOT_AIM_ACCURACY
	+ Stopped Axis bots in Single Player from throwing grenades (may later want to make it just when scripted, or just very rare)
	+ Hooked up SPDEVMAP to force gametype 0 (single player) and to allow cheats.
	+ Added bot script command FaceAngles to let bots face directions
	+ Fixed bug in Bot_ScriptAction_Trigger when you triggered an action on
	  yourself by name instead of with "self"

---------------- BUILD 024 - QuakeCon - 2.00q-MP (missionpack)

14-08-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added custom rendering for prone hands.
	+ Added basic smoke grenade effects.
	+ Headshot damage now also uses the distance falloff damage code, reduces headshot damage up to 20% of 50.
	+ Fixed GPG40 thirdperson model.

28-06-2002

	+ Added user profiles, a mod can state if it wants to use it by returning qtrue to UI_USESPROFILES in vmMain of the UI. A profile is active when the cl_profile string is set, resulting in wolfconfig_mp.cfg and servercache.dat being used from <gamedir>/profiles/<cl_profile>/.

			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>

---------------- BUILD 016 - 2.00h-MP (missionpack)

20-06-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>

20-06-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>

	+ Upped MAX_SHADERS to 8192 to deal with q3map2.

	+ Added ability to specify a "length" to vehicles for spline paths, allowing the angles to be calculated well for a vehicle with origin not at centre
	+ Modified the RT_RAIL_CORE to allow different texture scaling to be done from game code, and width modifications from game code too.
	+ Added misc_beam entity to allow drawing of ropes/"lasers", targets 1 entity (target only) or 2 (start and target)
			
19-06-2002
			Tim		<tim@maddocsoftware.com>

	+ Added two new server variables for bots: bot_numAlliedPlayers and bot_numAxisPlayers. These two vars are meant to be mutually exclusive with bot_minplayers.

18-06-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added screen bobbing for prone mode.
	+ Changed prone mode to require a player to be crouched before double tap forward makes them go into prone.
	+ Smoothened screen bobbing when a player stops moving. Previously it would snap to the center, now it lerps back to it.
	+ Lowered rotation speed for prone mode, this is sensitivity independant.

			Gordon	<djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Added support for mg42s to be placed on moving objects, still a little buggy in places
	+ Added support for loading tags server side, currently limited to cut down .tag file, should probably extend it to extract tags from md3/mdc files too.
	
17-06-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Moved pcx loading fix from Radiant code into renderer.
	+ Stopped player from being able to use a fixed MG42 when in prone mode.
	+ When bot_enable wasn't set, the bot code wouldn't be initialized. The main worker loop for bots would still be initiated though, causing problems.

11-06-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>

	+ Added trigger_flagonly_multiple for multiple flag triggers (always removes flag from player)
	+ Removed removeflag script function
	+ Added disarm dynamite sound playing for func_constructibles
	+ Added "dynamited" and "difused" triggers for trigger_objective_infos for dynamite planting/defusing, to allowing stopping of script_movers in mp_giant

07-06-2002

	+ Fixed dual func_constructible targetting trigger_objective_info entities generating two constructible markers at times.
	+ Bumped version number to 2.00f-MP
	+ Added support for animated misc_gamemodels (client sided animation). Spawnflags 2 and the 'frames' key enable this.
	+ Added .skin support for misc_gamemodels, usuable through the 'skin' key in the entity.

06-06-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>
	+ Removed g_e3_forcehqsupport cvar.
	+ Changed construction to take the full power bar again.
	
			Gordon	<djbob@splashdamage.com>
	+ Changed score backend to support the full 64 max clients (just bumping up the max clients results in buffer max size being hit, upping buffer not possible as this exceeds max length for server command)
	+ Created smaller scoreboard version for if team size > 16 players	

05-06-2002
			Arnout	<rr2do2@splashdamage.com>

	+ Made new classes show on the scoreboard.
	+ Added new classes throughout the game and cgame source where needed.
	+ Fixed ammoTable[] in bg_misc.c as it was one entry short, is now synced with weapon_t.

	+ Changed all #ifdef MISSIONPACK to #ifdef TEAMARENA so we can use the former for the XP.
	+ For missionpack, team only uses 1 bit in mpSetup, classes use 3 to allow for the newer classes.
	+ Moved the defines used for the mpSetup bits to bg_public.h. They aren't used by the engine and only gamecode uses the MISSIONPACK definitions.
	+ Moved Engineer is now Construction Engineer, moved all bits no longer belonging to this class to the Sapper.
