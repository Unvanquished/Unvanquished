  {
    "In this section you will find a summary of major changes since 1.1. It is "
    "not a complete list. In general, all things have been tweaked for balance in "
    "some way.\n\n"
    "We hope you enjoy playing. Your support gives us valuable data and "
    "feedback as we work to bring you Tremulous 1.2. Please report all bugs. Thank "
    "you."
  }
  "Alien Healing"
  {
    "The most important change for Alien players to know is that their healing "
    "rate is slower away from creep. To counter this, healing near Boosters "
    "and Basilisks is greatly accelerated.\n\n"
    "Watch the health cross icon on your "
    "HUD to see what your healing rate is. If the icon glows, you are on "
    "creep. If you are near a booster or basilisk, you will see two "
    "(2X healing) or four (3X healing) barbs around the health cross."
  }
  "Build-point Changes"
  {
    "Structures destroyed by enemy players will not immediately become available "
    "for reuse, but instead enter a queue. Build points will gradually leave the "
    "queue to become available again, at a rate proportional to the amount of "
    "points in the queue.\n\n Repeaters can be built at any stage and come with 20 "
    "BP that can only be used nearby to facilitate making small outposts. Aliens "
    "do not have a structure that provides additional buildpoints, but they have 150 "
    "overall BP to compensate."
  }
  "Marked Deconstruction"
  {
    "The deconstruction method has changed. Buildables are no longer instantly "
    "deconstructed. Instead, a deconstruct mark appears on the health bar. "
    "Go ahead and build a new buildable somewhere else and the old one will "
    "be removed automatically. Buildables that are about to be removed by "
    "constructing the selected buildable glow red."
  }
  "Alien Buildables"
  {
    "Nearly useless in 1.1, Barricades now have more health, are cheaper to "
    "build, and will shrink to allow Aliens to pass over them. Acid tubes "
    "will fire from behind barricades, providing a formidable defense. "
    "Experiment with blocking off hallways and building staged defenses, but "
    "keep in mind that low ceilings will prevent Tyrants from returning inside "
    "the base. Hives are also much improved to become worth building in stage 3."
  }
  "Human Buildables"
  {
    "Turrets now have a small spin up delay before firing, but they have "
    "increased range and damage output.\n\n"
    "To protect against small Aliens getting inside "
    "the base, build Tesla Generators at Stage 3. Tesla Generators no longer "
    "require the Defense Computer to function. Instead, the Defense Computer "
    "will automatically repair Human buildables. Tesla Generators can fire "
    "over turrets. "
  }
  "Human Weapons"
  {
    "Most of the human projeciles have a small volume now, making them more "
    "effective against smaller targets.\n"
    "The Lucifer Cannon projectile can be fired faster but now takes longer "
    "to charge. You will be able to hear your teammates overcharge "
    "their Lucifer Cannon.\n"
    "The Flamer projectile now gains more of the velocity of its wielder, "
    "making it easier to chase down aliens without burning yourself to a "
    "crisp. Other weapons also have smaller changes."
  }
  "Lag Correction"
  {
    "While the Tremulous implementation of Neil Toronto's unlagged is "
    "becoming widely accepted, we also implement client-side improvements "
    "not possible in 1.1 servers. For those who insist on leading their "
    "attacks, setting cg_unlagged to 0 will disable backward reconcilliation "
    "on your hitscan weapons."
  }
  "Sprint"
  {
    "The sprint bind has changed from \"boost\" to \"+button8\"; you can bind it "
    "in the options menu or in the console (\\bind shift +button8). Now, instead "
    "of tapping the button while moving to start sprinting, just hold it down "
    "and let go to stop. Alternately, you can change this to a toggle behavior "
    "with cg_sprintToggle. \n\n"
  }
  "Dodge"
  {
    "Humans also have a new movement ability: dodge. You can bind it in the "
    "options menu or the console (\\bind shift +button6). When strafing or "
    "walking backwards, press the dodge key to make a quick, low jump. You "
    "can bind this to the same key as sprint in the console with \\bind shift "
    "\"+button8; +button6\""
  }
  "Headshots"
  {
    "Headshots on unarmored humans only cause 150% damage. Battlesuit and "
    "helmet protection have been reduced so headshot damage remains the same."
  }
  "Dretch"
  {
    "Dretches are slightly faster and can now damage any human structure while it "
    "is still building, but can no longer damage turrets and teslas that "
    "have been completed."
  }
  "Basilisk"
  {
    "Basilisks provide regeneration boosting auras to nearby teammates: 2x "
    "from regular and 3x from advanced basilisks. Their footsteps are also "
    "silent for greater stealth."
  }
  "Marauder"
  {
    "The Adv. Marauder's electric shock damage is no longer split between its "
    "targets, making it more effective against large groups of humans and "
    "buildables. Targets are now chosen slightly differently: instead of "
    "each new chain section originating from the previous target, it will "
    "originate from the first target."
  }
  "Dragoon"
  {
    "Advanced dragoons are now available at stage 2. Both dragoons have the "
    "range of their chomp attacks lowered, but their pounce attacks are much "
    "more useful. Try to use pounce to pin a human to the wall before chomping."
  }
  "Tyrant"
  {
    "The Tyrant is now a weaker class as its health has been lowered and "
    "turret damage is greater. To counter this, Tyrants can charge for longer "
    "periods of time, hit targets multiple times in a single charge, "
    "and crush any Humans they land on top of. Trample charge does not "
    "instantly release when full but can be held for two seconds. Trample "
    "attacks on a human pinned against a wall are VERY powerful. Use this to "
    "your advantage. The Tyrant's healing aura has been removed; find a "
    "booster or a basilisk to heal faster."
  }
}
