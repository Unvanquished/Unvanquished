/*
 * To better support mods the gamelogic is treated like any other asset and can
 * be downloaded from a server. However it is considered untrusted code so we
 * need to run it in a sandbox. We use NaCl to provide the sandboxing which
 * means that the gamelogic is in another process and that we have to use IPC and
 * shared memory to communicate with it.
 *
 * The gamelogic can be compiled to and ran from several executable formats that
 * will all start at the "main" function whose first job will be to retrieve the
 * root socket handle to communicate with the engine. The different executable
 * formats are:
 *  - A native shared library loaded at runtime and started in the engine process,
 * this shared lib exports a "main" function pointer which is called by the
 * engine, providing a handle to the root socket in argv[1]. Because the gamelogic
 * lives in the same process as the engine, any leaks in the gamelogic will be
 * engine leaks. However because it is in the same process, it is easier to debug
 * as the debugger doesn't automatically attach to child process.
 *  - An NaCl executable started in a new sandboxed process. The "main" function is
 * ran first and the root socket handle is given via an environment variable. This
 * is how the gamelogic is ran when we do not trust the code as it won't be able to
 * access anything apart from the file handles the engine gives it. When the NaCl
 * gamelogic exits the OS will clean up any leaks for us. It is also slightly slower
 * than native format (no SSE and code alignement constraints).
 *  - A native executable started in a new process, obviously the "main" function
 * is the first one ran. The root socket handle is given in argv[1]. It doesn't
 * provide sandboxing like the nacl executable but the OS will still clean up any
 * leak for us.
 *
 * TL;DR
 * - Native DLL: no sandboxing, no cleaning up but debugger support. Use for dev.
 * - NaCl exe: sandboxing, no leaks, slightly slower, hard to debug. Use for regular players.
 * - Native exe: no sandboxing, no leaks, hard to debug. Might be used by server owners for perf.
