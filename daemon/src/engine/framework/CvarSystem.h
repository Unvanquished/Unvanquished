/**
 * Cvar access and registration.
 *
 * Console Variables (Cvars) are values that are accessible by the user
 * (shown and modifiable in the console) as well as directly accessible
 * in the code. They are mostly used to expose parameters that can be
 * changed at runtime or saved/loaded from configuration files.
 *
 * Sometimes modules use cvars to communicate between each other but it
 * is bad practice.
 *
 * Cvars should be declared statically using the Cvar::Cvar class, see
 * common/Cvar for more details. Facilites are also provided to do more
 * "static checking" of cvars with types, bounds, ...
 *
 * There are two ways for the code to access cvars:
 *  - Through a Cvar::Cvar<Type> using .Get() and .Set() you then get
 *  parsing and serialization and other things for free. This type of
 *  cvar is used to control the behavior of local code (filename,
 *  fps limit, ...)
 *  - Through SetValue and GetValue when the cvar doesn't belong to
 *  the local code, for example when doing commands (/set ...)
