 * send/receive descriptors in the control message for
 * sendmsg/recvmsg.  Such buffers are often automatic variables.
 *
 * In Darwin, CMSG_SPACE uses __DARWIN_ALIGN.  And __DARWIN_ALIGN(p)
 * expands to
 *
 * ((__darwin_size_t)((char *)(__darwin_size_t)(p) + __DARNWIN_ALIGNBYTES)
 *  &~ __DARWIN_ALIGNBYTES)
 *
 * which Clang (to which many Apple employees contribute!) complains
 * about when invoked with -pedantic -- and with our -Werror, causes
 * Clang-based builds to fail.  Clang says this is not a constant
 * expression:
 *
 * error: variable length array folded to constant array as an
 * extension [-Werror,-pedantic]
 *
 * Possibly true per standard definition, since that cast to (char *)
 * is ugly, but actually Clang was able to convert to a compile-time
 * constant... it just had to work harder.
 *
 * As a ugly workaround, we define the following constant for use in
 * automatic array declarations, and in all cases have an assert to
 * verify that the value is of sufficient size.  (The assert should
 * constant propagate and be dead-code eliminated in normal compiles
 * and should cause a quick death if ever violated, since NaCl startup
 * code involves the use of descriptor passing through the affected
 * code.)
