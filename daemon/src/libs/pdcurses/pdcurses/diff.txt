****** overlay.c
            Compiler warning changes (mostly explicit type-casting).  These
            shouldn't actually affect the way the code works.  They either
            caused certain "nuisance" warnings to go away,  or enabled me to
            set higher warning levels without getting a flood of warnings.

****** getch.c
****** mouse.c
            Triple-click mouse support changes:

****** kernel.c
            Changes to allow different cursor types (block, underline,
            outline):

****** keyname.c
            Added names of new characters (Ctrl-semicolon,  Ctrl-0 through
            Ctrl-9,  etc.).

****** slk.c
            Almost re-wrote 'slk.c' entirely to allow for many different
            possible SLK  layouts,  and to allow changing them in mid-run.
            See 'newtest.c' for how that works,  or read comments in the code.
            (And yes,  it is all backward-compatible.)

****** termattr.c
            Changed to add left/right-line and italic styles.

****** window.c
            Changed to avoid accessing uninitialized variables when
            debugging.  (Not a security/stability issue,  I hasten to
            add.  Just that the debug info was garbage.)

   'curses.h' changes:

         Added 64-bit chtypes,  and A_OVERLINE and A_STRIKEOUT #defines
         Added a line (currently commented out) redefining KEY_MAX to allow
            for a slew of new keys (see above comment on 'keyname.c')
         Added six more mouse buttons (only two of which are supported as
            yet,  and those only in Win32a... but I wanted to future-proof)
         Be warned:  if you look in 'pdcwin.h' in the Win32a directory,
            you'll see _many_ proposed changes for 'curses.h':
                -- #defines for cursor styles;
                -- #defines for additional alternate character set characters;
                -- #defines for keys not currently recognized in Curses,
                     even though every flavor probably could recognize them
                     (Ctl-0 through Ctl-9,  for example)
                -- prototype and #defines for PDC_set_function_key( ).
